nfl," TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM

A few months ago, I posted a poll to rank the best wide receivers in the league, and I was astonished to see D.J. Moore was ranked 23rd. He has consistently been one of the most productive receivers in the league, despite horrible QB play. Today, I‚Äôm going to outline why he should‚Äôve been much, MUCH higher.

In each of the last three seasons, he has posted at least 1200 yards, making him the ONLY receiver in the entire league to do so. No other receiver in the league has had 1200 yards in each of the last three years.

In that same three year period, he ranks 4th in the entire NFL in yards by a wide receiver, behind only Cooper Kupp, Davante Adams, and Stefon Diggs.

He has done this despite the Panthers passing offense ranking dead last in passer rating and 29th in EPA per dropback in that same time period.

I know what you‚Äôre saying. ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs just a target merchant then. He gets so many yards because he‚Äôs always being thrown at.‚Äù

In those same 3 years, he ranks 5th in targets and 4th in yards per target by receivers with similar target volume. Each of the receivers ahead of him in yards is also ahead of him in targets, as is Keenan Allen.

That means he‚Äôs producing on par with other great receivers, rather than simply getting thrown at a ton.

I‚Äôll take this opportunity to compare him, his production, and his QB situation to Terry McLaurin, who most people agree is a top 10-15 receiver (he ranked 13th on the same consensus poll) who suffers from bad QB play. All stats are since 2019 and ranked against all wide receivers in the same timeframe.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, statistically they are very close, but Moore leads in almost all stats (the only ones McLaurin leads in are yards per route run in 2019 and yards per target, both of which he is barely ahead in.)

This is despite the stats indicating that they‚Äôve both had roughly the same caliber of terrible quarterback play, with McLaurin‚Äôs being just a tad bit less shit than Moore‚Äôs

So, if Moore has McLaurin beat at pretty much everything statistical, and Moore has slightly worse QB play, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense for Moore to be ranked in the top 12, ahead of McLaurin?

Stats are from Pro Football Reference, Statmuse, Pro Football Focus, and RBSDM. If you have questions about anything, I'd love to answer them.

TL;DR: D.J. Moore is one of the most productive receivers in the league, he has some of, if not THE worst QB play in the league,  and he outproduces Terry McLaurin at pretty much everything, and yet this sub ranks him far lower than McLaurin.",Here's why D.J. Moore is one of the most underrated receivers in the NFL

nfl,,Warren Sapp Claims Colin Kaepernick‚Äôs Raiders Workout Was a Disaster
nfl,"I was looking at some old highlights the other day of defensive mega stars such as B Dawkins and Lawrence Taylor and a thought came over my head.. 

We will never see a dominant defensive player again. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there will always be ‚Äúdominance‚Äù in the game of offense vs. defense because that‚Äôs what the game is. 

But these guys today can‚Äôt hit and can‚Äôt cover without being penalized, it‚Äôs not a balanced game whatsoever. It‚Äôs a different game, before watching players get lit up and watching players actually be able to sack a QB. 

It makes me worry because the more valuable the NFL becomes the more valuable offense becomes. No normal non football fan wants to watch a defensive game. It sucks too, I love that stuff. And even if it was 60/40 or 70/30 I‚Äôd keep quiet.. but man these guys can‚Äôt even guard receivers! 

It‚Äôs very annoying because the game has been tuned for maximum revenue. Maximum offense, maximum sports bets, and it‚Äôs just sad to see. 

Also side note: ESPN, Stephen A, Adam Shefter and the rest of these psychopaths can stay the hell away in my book! They try to appeal to too many people, it makes me enjoy so much less.

nfl,"This is probably unpopular but I'm glad that this sub has opened arguments about whether Brady or Peyton is the best QB ever because it now opens the door for guys like Joe Gibbs and Vince Lombardi in the best coach conversation as well.

With the Brady discussions I think this sub has come to the consensus that:

# 1) greatest = most accomplished, greatest career

# 2) best = talent, in a vacuum who can do the most

So Bill is no doubt the *greatest* *champion* of all time but that doesn't necessarily make him the *best coach* of all time.

**I  believe that Joe Gibbs for sure holds that title. 3 Super Bowls with a solid but not HOF QB and two mediocre QB's is nothing short of unbelievable.

For my team, Kenyan Drake never seemed to be a lead back while with the Dolphins but then he seemingly became that for us when we traded for him during the 2019 season to replace David Johnson. We then traded DJ for Hopkins and made Drake our primary RB in 2020 which ended up with him being respectable but flipping back to a rotational RB as Chase Edmonds outplayed him for quite a few stretches that season, leading us to letting him walk the next off-season.

nfl,"
Burrow is a mixed bag for me. I'm gonna be careful with how I talk about him so I dont cause public outrage. He is overrated but I can't deny the talent. Burrow has some moments where he looks like Joe Montana resurrected and some moments that make me want to throw up. You can't deny that having good weapons definitely helped Burrow look better but you could say the same about Mahomes and Allen. It's a team game. If Burrow, Mahomes, Allen and Herbert didn't have any weapons then they probably wouldn't be as good. Please lord give this man a good O-Line. Overall if he continues performing well we could have a legend among us ;). He still has a lot to prove though.

Being in the same division as Mahomes Wilson and Carr isn't the best situation to be in. Herbert has the potential to be a monster for years to come but I feel like he's slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong he's a top 5 QB in the AFC but it seems to me that some people like to act like Herbert's gonna be the next messiah. Still a lot of question marks especially as to how he would perform in the playoffs. Overall he's talented but he still has a lot to prove. Please lord make his team better.

Allen is arguably the most talented QB in the AFC. The dude is progressing so much its insane. While having a amazing defense and Diggs definitely helped, he can be amazing sometimes. The Chiefs vs Bills game is a perfect example. While I disagree with people saying he had a better game then Mahomes, he still had a amazing game. I'm still worried his style of play might get him injured. I've seen the dude hurdle people more then I've seen him slide. Overall the dude has the potential to win multiple MVPs and Super Bowl's. Please lord don't get this man injured. There is only one man and team standing in his way. Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.

Mahomes is the best player in the AFC. As I've said multiple times having good weapons definitely helps but we have seen the dude perform well without them. People are definitely overreacting to his 2021 season. When having 4,839 yards 37 TDs 13 INTs is considered a down year then you know your pretty good. This is probably Patrick's most important year. You just lost Tyreek and people are starting to doubt you. If you go and perform like crazy then you prove once and for all that you have what it takes to be a top 10 QB in NFL history. The only thing that I think can stop Mahomes is his own team. Please lord don't let his defense perform like they did in the beginning of 2021. Overall if everything goes right Mahomes could be a top 10 QB in history.

Overall Mahomes will probably be the best 10 years from now with Josh Allen close behind him. Way to many question marks with Herbert. And Burrow has great potential. I hope I didn't hurt anyone's feelings  when I said that Burrow is overrated since a lot of people in this sub seems to be Burrow's biggest fan. I don't want to piss off the Golden Boys fans. Also Herbert is better then Burrow fight me.","Out of Mahomes, Allen, Herbert and Burrow who do you think has the biggest potential to be the best 10 years from now."

Regardless of sex, the decision today is a violation of our fundamental rights to privacy and as a fanbase, we need to make that clear to the NFL.

It sucks, that this is the only way that a message can be sent across, it really does but this is a legitimate way that we as fans can make a difference for something that is bigger than us. 

Obviously, this alone will not create change overnight, but it is a step in the right direction to create a future for our country that is based on the principles of freedom and liberty. 

What do we need for this to get going?

* Voices - fans to send emails to the people that can actually get the message across within the NFL
* Emails/contact information - I really tried looking for ways to contact the NFL but could not find any
* Organization - we need to make this as easy as possible for all of us so that we can get a lot of fans to join the effort

I drafted a light email that we could mass send to representatives if we can get their contact information. (I'm literally a student in college and have no idea how to get started with something like this, if anyone has information on how to organize effectively or any experience with this kind of thing before, that would be amazing).

 Hello,

As you already know today, the decision of overturning Roe v. Wade has devastated¬†the lives of many of the fans of the NFL, as well as set the precedent to impact the lives of thousands in the future.¬†

The measures the NFL took to deter hosting Superbowls¬†in states that did support¬†discrimination based on¬†gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation, was an act of bravery and reaffirmed the NFL's position to stray on the side of individual liberty, equity, and support for their fanbase.¬†

I urge you to stand with your fans on issues that matter the most. The NFL has the power¬†to make a change, and doing so will reaffirm your commitment to us and our commitment¬†to the organization as a whole.¬†

Best,

I mean being overrated almost entirely something based off the fans perception of said players. And there are some players that  fans just can't stop bringing to a God Tier level any time there name is mentioned.

I wanna go first. And no I'm not a hater of this player at all. He was actually one of my favorites. But his fanboys overrate him to an absurd degree. 

PAT MAH-..... It's Josh Allen.

Jesus H Christ. Don't ever get into a conversation with fanboys about how good Josh Allen is. Like can't you see is farmboy swag exude on the field? Josh Allen is a terminator. He can do it an all an no one can stop him. 

Here's my thing. I can accept the fact that Josh Allen is good as hell. But the way these fanboys talk about ugh. I heard plenty of people say Josh Allen is the most athletic QB they have ever seen. Uhhh whet?

He's not even the most athletic QB in the League. Do people have short term memory loss? Because Last Time I checked Pat Mahones, Aaron Rodgers, Lamar Jackson, Russell Wilson, Deshaun Watson, Marcos Mariota, and Mitch all are just as athletic as Allen if not more athletic. Only some falling a little short in the arm strength department such as Watson.

And also if he is the most athletic you seen? Did when did you start watching football? I mean surely you started only this year because if you been watching Football for the last 6 or 7 years you would have seen just as impressive prime time athletic plays from Cam Newton before he hung it up. 

I just ran into one of the dumbest posts ever in football. Which was comparing Josh Allens rushing TDs versus the first 4 years of Buffalos Marshawn Lynch. Now I get that somewhat this post was meant as a joke to Spite the Lamar Jackson narrative that he's a running back....

But damn don't let anyone in the comment sections know that. Apparently Josh Allen is apparently better than Marshawn Lynch was because all that's what's been said in the comment sections. Like Jesus. Talk about the overhype meter through the roof.",Who is the most overrated player in the league right now?

* **Step 1:** A [Call to Rankers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/su150z/rnfl_top_100_of_the_2021_season_call_for_rankers/) right after the Super Bowl 
  
* **Step 2:** Rankers from each team nominated players to rank, with a **10 game minimum threshold.** Players are associated with the team they played for in 2021

* **Step 3:** The Grind. We instructed users to tier positions groups into T25, T50, etc based on **2021 regular season play only.** This took several weeks as the rankers tiered each position group and discussed them. There were no individual player threads and no arbitrary position caps. Just questions and rankings.
 
* **Step 4:** Users submitted their own personal **Top 125 lists**. 
   
* **Step 5:** User lists were reviewed by myself, u/mattkud , and u/MikeTysonChicken . The rankers were expected to answer questions about their lists. They were allowed to make any changes to their list, and were not forced to make any changes
  
* **Step 6:** *The Reveal‚Ä¶* where we are now!  
  
And without further ado, here are the players ranked 100-91 in the r/nfl Top 100 Players of the 2021 Season!

***Key Stat:*** Ryan Ramczyk is PFF‚Äôs 2nd highest graded tackle since 2019

___

**Written by:** u/Ian_Udani 

Coming off 3 consecutive AP seasons, Ryan Ramczyk looked poised for another season as one of the best tackles in football. Unfortunately, he was not immune to the injury bug that tore through the Saints OL group this season and he was only able to play in 10 non-consecutive games. He played well when on the field, only giving up 2 sacks and finishing with a respectable 84.1 grade from PFF (if you are into that kind of thing). It was apparent he was playing through the pain though and missing 7 games contributed to his tremendous slide down the rankings of the list this year.
Just watch his play [here in plays 4-2](https://youtu.be/E_w6mZXleKA?t=126) He can still absolutely maul people off the line.
He is expected to come back completely healthy this season and his presence on the line will be felt even more in the wake of Terron Armstead's departure to Miami in the offseason.

***Key Stat:*** Javon Hargrave finished 2nd in pass rush win rate among IDL‚Äôs

___

**Written by:** u/wrhslax1996

Coming in at #99 on the r/NFL Top 100 list for 2021 is Javon Hargrave, Defensive Tackle of the Philadelphia Eagles. Hargrave earned his spot on this list through stellar pass rush, good run defense, and generally living in the heads and backfields of opposing offenses. 

In terms of run defense, Hargrave was an absolute menace throughout the year. [This right here](https://twitter.com/syedschemes/status/1439649335059300352) is a stellar play by Hargrave and fellow DT Fletcher Cox during the week 2 matchup against the San Francisco 49ers. Hargrave shoots off the line with a head full of steam, engages the LG and penetrates 2 yards into the backfield while flowing with the play. Cox, having done his job, redirects the running back right into Hargrave's lap for a really nice tackle for loss. Hargrave's ability to engage, gain ground, and shed blocks effectively helped prevent the Eagles run defense from being a total nightmare. [Here is another example](https://twitter.com/syedschemes/status/1439647461983887363) of how insane his get-off is. A 6'2"" 305lb man should not be able to move that fast, but he penetrates immediately. He beats the center who simply can not reach him in time and, at the same time, disrupts the pulling guard's timing, thus notching himself another TFL. Finally, [watch him beat the league's best guard](https://twitter.com/Nate_Tice/status/1445440288349044745) to notch another run stop. Zack Martin is a mean, aggressive, and smart player but Hargrave knows exactly what he needs to do to prevent Martin from getting hands on. He swims Martin beautifully here, getting into the backfield quickly and getting a really nice stop.

As a pass-rusher, I think 2021 was Hargrave's best season yet. He was constantly in opposing backfields putting QBs on their asses. We'll start by looking at [this dominance against Dallas' Tyler Biadasz](https://twitter.com/76Iggles/status/1442649178849562628). Hargrave is lightning quick in his get off and immediately gets hands on the young center. He uses his brute strength to put Biadasz on skates, sheds the block, and forces a fumble which would end up being recovered by Fletcher Cox for a defensive touchdown. [Here's another rep against a better center](https://twitter.com/thomasrp93/status/1444736058718134274). Creed Humphrey was, without a doubt, an insanely good center as a rookie. That didn't matter on this rep, as Hargrave's insane get-off left Humphrey stumbling. This rep showcases Hargrave's ability to really kick himself into a second gear once he breaks through an initial block. He defeats his block and covers the 7-8 yards between himself and Mahomes in no time. Poor Clyde Edwards-Helaire did what he could, but Javon gives him a little forearm shiver and engulfs Mahomes for a really nice sack. Finally, it would be doing Hargrave a disservice to leave out his performance during week 1's matchup against the Falcons. Hargrave gave rookie OG Jalen Mayfield fits all night, as Mayfield drew a pretty tough matchup in his first pro action. I think [this play right here](https://twitter.com/austingayle_/status/1437479296688402441) adequately depicts the kind of night Hargrave had. Hargrave gets off quick (noticing a trend here?) and uses his brick-like hands to immediately throw off Mayfield's base. Hargrave keeps his momentum concentrated on Mayfield's outside shoulder so that, when the time comes to shed the block, he's able to do so effectively and really just crush Matt Ryan. 

Javon Hargrave finished 2021 with 63 total tackles, 7.5 sacks, 61 pressures, 44 hurries, 9 QB Hits, and a well-deserved pro bowl bid.

***Key Stat:*** Roquan Smith was the only player to have at least 90 solo tackles in both 2020 and 2021

_____

**Written by:** u/Ownange

Roquan Smith was the solid foundation for which Sean Desai could build his defense around in 2021.  Roquan can, and has done it all. He played all 17 games, was rock solid on a team that was trotting out the likes of Alec Ogeltree or Danny Trevathan as their second Linebacker. 

Leading the team in tackles by almost double the next closest Bear, Roquan used his agility to be all over the field, a destructive force against the run on a team hurting for run defenders with the absences of Khalil Mack and Akiem Hicks. Roquan would actually lead the league in stops, a PFF stat defined as ‚Äúa solo tackle, including sacks, that constitutes an offensive failure.‚Äù Roquan‚Äôs 67 would lead all linebackers and be an important part of the Bears‚Äô defense.

When it came to coverage, Roquan was equally impressive. While Roquan‚Äôs statline isn‚Äôt boasting the outstanding interception totals of standout coverage linebackers like, Darius Leonard, [Roquan‚Äôs one interception on the year](https://streamable.com/xuwey8) was a pick six against Joe Burrow, which would lead him to throw two more en route to a Bears victory over the AFC champs. 

Roquan‚Äôs 2021 was a great season, and he will be a foundation of this new Erberflus Bears for years to come.

_______

**Written by:** u/Hepppster

In a year where Amari Cooper disappeared at times, Gallup had a couple of injuries, and our running game having troubles in the second half, CD Lamb really stepped up as the Cowboys #1 weapon on an offense that ranked #1 in PPG.
  
If you wanna go stats, he's tied for the 3rd most ""missed tackles forced"" with JaMarr Chase (behind Deebo, Kupp) and tied for 5th in YAC/Rec with Mike Williams (behind Deebo, Chase, Godwin and Kupp) showcasing he's one of the best after the catch receivers in the league; 8th overall in Yds/Rec as well. And of course you have the typical 1100 Recieving Yard season expected of a top Receiver.

If you wanna go film/context well, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AETRFo4gNH4) you go in terms of a highlights reel! Kept us in the game against the Buccaneers, beats James Bradberry easy on the Fade route, and was the main reason we end up beating the Patriots in OT (also was the reason we got to OT in the first place). Happy with what he's done for Cowboys in just two short years, and ready for the future for him as the true #1 Receiver on the Cowboys!

***Key Stat:*** Kyler Murray topped the league in PFF‚Äôs Deep Big Time Throws (34) and deep throw accuracy (54.9%)
________

**Written by:** u/calboy238

Kyler Murray‚Äôs third year brought more of what Cardinals fans (and the rest of the league) have come to expect from the former no. 1 overall pick ‚Äì [breathtaking highs](https://youtu.be/2PftSjuqbuc?t=684) but [incredibly cringe-worthy lows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPvdoxMa8o0). But looking past the meme-worthy low-lights that provide fodder for many on Twitter and Reddit, year 3 brought significant steps up in many [statistical categories](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MurrKy00.htm) over 2020, including yards per attempt (7.1 --&gt; 9.7), QB rating (94.3 --&gt; 100.6), and passing yards per game (248.2 --&gt; 270.5). The Cardinals front office invested in weapons for Murray this year, with returning receivers like [Christian Kirk](https://youtu.be/EMD8z0K5ioE?t=54), along with new additions such as AJ Green ([highlight 1](https://youtu.be/QzjnugM8RXM?t=96), [highlight 2](https://youtu.be/GHd3MogRLPE?t=56)) and [Rondale Moore](https://youtu.be/ru7SserH_-Y), as well as mid-season acquisition [Zach Ertz](https://youtu.be/Tfe5_4LLtcc) making an impact on the field. And of course, until hamstring and then knee injuries shortened his season, Deandre Hopkins showed why he is an absolute beast of a wide receiver ([highlight 1](https://youtu.be/Aog9RuHLS7E?t=92), [highlight 2](https://youtu.be/lR2QMF_Bruo?t=26),[highlight 3](https://youtu.be/EMD8z0K5ioE?t=201)). Even as injuries accumulated later in the season, Murray made use of unproven young receivers such as [Antoine Wesley](https://youtu.be/GHd3MogRLPE?t=446).   

No discussion of Kyler Murray is complete solely focusing on his ability throwing the ball. Despite having a smaller volume of runs in 2021 compared to previous years, Murray regularly showed off his dual-threat prowess. On numerous occasions, he rolled out of the pocket to evade pressure before finding a receiver downfield, often to highlight-inducing results ([highlight 1](https://youtu.be/GHd3MogRLPE?t=179), [highlight 2](https://youtu.be/Aog9RuHLS7E?t=308)). Additionally, Murray took advantage of [designed runs](https://youtu.be/Xw2zKnyFjO0) to showcase his agility and pure speed once in open space. At his peak, Murray continued to show just how feared he (rightfully) is as both a runner and a passer this year. If only he could remain at that peak for a full season.

_____________

**Written by:** u/MysticTyph00n

Entering into his 10th season and fresh off of a Super Bowl victory, the long-time stalwart of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense came and took care of business per usual. He took a small step backwards in production, but still was able to amass quality numbers in only 12 games played. He only finished behind Devin White in total tackles on the team, and added two more FFs to his franchise leading number in that category.   


While his numbers this year weren't remarkable by any means (and especially the standards we hold Lavonte David to typically) they, along with his play on the field, was all still cromulent enough to catch the eyes of the rankers this year. Need to cherish the quality years we still have of this man.

***Key Stat:*** PFF gave Wyatt Teller the 6th best Gap Blocking grade and 3rd best Zone Blocking grade among guards
__________________

**Written by:** u/sanswagata

Wyatt Teller is known around the league as one of the best guards in football. He broke out in 2020 when he was named a second team all-pro, but he topped that season in 2021. This past season, he played all 17 games, made his first pro bowl, and was once again named a second team all-pro. Proving that he can not only be one of the best hogs in the league, but that he is also dependable and can survive 18 weeks of playing the most grueling position in football.

Not only is Teller one of the best guards in the NFL, but he is one of the more fun players to watch in the NFL regardless of position. He consistently bullies other players, shows high level athleticism, and even has a habit of performing [these cute little somersaults](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1336040425489043458?s=20&amp;t=SiiJTNiLh6EyfbmYafXjCg). This combination of athleticism and the mentality to physically dominate players shows up every week. He will not only abuse defenders in the run game, but also [put them on their face in pass protection too](https://twitter.com/bengals_sans/status/1538222117673648129?s=20&amp;t=-NQP56ZJviTPZGwuybBZAg). He has to lead the league in pancakes from pass protection. Teller showcases exactly why pass protection is not passive as he [smashes into the defensive lineman's ribs](https://streamable.com/8nfmn3) with enough force to cripple a regular human being. Of course, that guy is fine (NFL athletes lol), but he's going to think twice before pinning his ears back and trying to rush the passer now.

Teller makes sure that the defense can feel his presence in every game. As I'm sure you could guess, he is also a [dominant run blocker](https://streamable.com/0c0cfl). Not only will he bulldoze defenders and move them where they don't want to go, but he has a lot of the finer points of run blocking down as well. [He can flip his hips and seal defenders on zone plays](https://streamable.com/9gp3ij) and almost always has his body in good positioning for the running back to read him. To go with this mentality, strength, and technical ability, he is also an extremely athletic guard. When he gets into the open field, [he rarely misses](https://streamable.com/jqbai9). Even if he [stumbles out of his stance](https://streamable.com/wew51q) initially. If there is one player who exemplifies everything an offensive lineman stands for, it's Wyatt Teller.

***Key Stat:*** Dionte Johnson had 533 yards after the catch, 6th best in the league
_______________

**Written by:** u/Astro63

Last we heard from Diontae Johnson, a league-leading 13 drops in 2020 contributed to a disastrous end-of-season collapse that labeled Diontae as public enemy #1 in Pittsburgh. Questions surrounded him all off-season about whether he was reliable enough or even good enough to be the Steelers' top receiver. In response, Diontae quietly got to work and focused on fixing his drop issues and refining his strengths to be the playmaker he needed to be. What followed was his best season as a pro, solidifying his status as WR1, and even stating his case among the league‚Äôs best young receivers. In an offense where basically everything was working against him to be successful, Diontae posted career highs in receptions (107), Yardage (1161), First Downs (59), and Touchdowns (8). Most importantly to many, Diontae cut his drop rate down from 13 drops on 144 targets (9% rate) in 2020 to only 5 drops on 169 targets (3% rate) in 2021; a clear testament to how hard he worked to clean up that issue. 

To further contextualize these stats, and what makes them so impressive; one needs to look at the offense he was operating in. Big Ben no longer had the arm strength he used to and opposing defenses knew that. With no reliable threat of the deep ball, teams were free to stack the box and play tight press coverage while attacking a young offensive line that struggled to hold up in pass protection. This would be a challenge for any WR1 to try and make plays against, and doubly so when no one else could consistently take the pressure off them, but Diontae stepped up to the challenge. All season long, it felt like every crucial third-down was caught by Diontae even when everyone in the stadium knew where the ball was going. His ability to make sharp and fluid cuts right out of his break to open small windows of separation was vital to getting the offense going and beating the ever-present man coverage looks. For all the flak he caught for being unreliable heading into the season, the tables turned to the point where Diontae was the only receiver Pittsburgh could rely on to make big plays. Little to no receivers were as productive in as tough a situation as Diontae was, and that speaks volumes to how talented of a player he really is.

Being praised by [Bill Belichick is a good sign of a player's skill](https://youtu.be/JEY74Zo9SUw?t=49). Signing a deal to make 20 million in one of the years is another good sign. Having the third most sacks for your team in his first four seasons than any other player in Titans history except for the Freak? Yeah, all things considered Harold Landry is a damn good linebacker.

With just one more game on the schedule than previous year, he more than doubled his sack total to 12. It was enough combined with 75 tackles to help lead the Titans defense and team to their first AFC South title in a long time.

#**#91 - Chidobe Awuzie - Cincinnati Bengals - Cornerback**

***Key Stat:*** Awuzie claims to be undefeated in chess against his Bengals teammates, including against [noted chess enthusiast Joe Burrow](https://twitter.com/chesscom/status/1493003114504507396}
________

**Written by:** u/confederalis

In 2021, Chidobie Awuzie emerged from the doldrums of Dallas' defense to become a clear-cut CB1 on a team that desperately needed one, earning the #91 rank on the /r/NFL Top100 List. Awuzie was a part of Cincinnati‚Äôs aggressive free agency class and the Bengals‚Äô trust in him paid off, as he played at a consistently elite level all the way to a Super Bowl appearance. Chido gave hope to a team that would‚Äôve had to deal with [CB1 Eli Apple](https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2019/03/18/PJDLHOGNPM2YKPKS3FRXPS2LIE.jpg?auto=webp) if he wasn‚Äôt there, which itself is enough for Top 100.

But his stats are also enough. Awuzie‚Äôs season was one of being constantly peppered with targets, resulting in the 2nd highest target rate in the league. Even with this high target rate, Awuzie was credited with only allowing 3 TDs and accruing 2 penalties, consistently playing clean in his role. Additionally, Chido had the 11th highest average depth of target in the league, yet only allowed 9.8 yd/rec (4th best) and a long of 41 yards (10th best), illustrating terrific prevention of big plays. Moreso, Awuzie‚Äôs 3.45 YAC/rec (5th best) and above-average missed tackle rate emphasize his toughness and ability to keep receivers in front of him. Awuzie‚Äôs coverage was the shining point of his game this year, as he prevented the big play and played incredibly clean, even adding 10 PBUs (4th best on a per snap basis) and 3 picks to a tremendous resume.

Stats don‚Äôt tell the whole story, though, and Awuzie‚Äôs film helps showcase his remarkable toughness and consistency, even in the face of the game‚Äôs best receivers. [Here](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1465651017916289033/pu/vid/1280x720/jDV4cqBcBiTNh-lR.mp4?tag=12), Awuzie shows off his elite play recognition to break up a pass to Diontae and [here](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1478339807734636545/pu/vid/1280x720/jrjceq06BlFGYNsy.mp4?tag=12), Awuzie perfectly blankets Tyreek on the sideline, forcing an incompletion. He also consistently used his speed and recovery ability to break up passes downfield, like [here](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1437406234349539334/pu/vid/1280x720/Xn-fsXZBjhDaQQpR.mp4?tag=12) against Jefferson and [here](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1470857096862347265/pu/vid/1280x720/ibbVmlfxDMreecct.mp4?tag=12) downfield against the 49ers. The most impressive of these downfield plays on the ball was when Chido picked off Herbert by [literally ripping the ball from Josh Palmer‚Äôs hands](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1468186624055992324/pu/vid/1280x720/yB-ym6QTsNeLgu9C.mp4?tag=12). Awuzie is much stronger than his frame shows, and you can see this when he excelles at [slipping through](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1448095580627083266/pu/vid/1264x720/o4V82KkMFzEkhbxC.mp4?tag=12) and [shaking off](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1468181703726358531/pu/vid/1280x720/GuBStJDW7VDRHvqv.mp4?tag=12) blocks to make strong tackles at the line of scrimmage. Ironically, Awuzie‚Äôs best game was probably also the game where he gave up the most yards: the Bengals' Week 5 matchup with Green Bay. Awuzie gave up 90 yards to Davante Adams while fighting a nagging injury, yet still showed the incredible [toughness](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1448309604035727371/pu/vid/1254x720/Fs3ELFeZeGjOrZ0g.mp4?tag=12) and skill in guarding the game‚Äôs best that we now come to expect from him. In probably his [top highlight of the season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Bn5hn1QY4&amp;ab_channel=NFL), Awuzie blankets Adams down the sideline and makes a great play on the ball to pick off Rodgers. Even when Adams made big gains, Chido was still [covering him perfectly](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1448437666937249796/pu/vid/1280x720/dWqRLu4T4DY7mLDv.mp4?tag=12), proving that those 90 yards given up don‚Äôt tell the whole story. The Packers game truly was Awuzie‚Äôs coming-out party and he continued to consistently play at this elite level for the remainder of the season, including when he [picked off Matt Stafford on the game‚Äôs biggest stage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSdXwDloxUk&amp;ab_channel=TherealDanielfoxjr) 

Chidobe Awuzie broke out in 2021, becoming an elite CB1 that I personally ranked much higher than just #91. The toughness, intelligence, and skill are there for Chido to continue on as a top 10 corner in the league and I am eager to see if he continues to perform at this caliber in 2022.

nfl,"I posted this in nfl draft reddit but thought it might be better here.

From 1969 to 1974 the steelers drafted 9 hall of famers and signed an undrafted one. I will preface this with the fact that I am an avid steelers fan and history buff.

1969-Joe Greene, an all time great DT was drafted first and later L.C. Greenwood played pro bowl level at DE for years.

1970-drafted hall of fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw and later Mel Blount, often considered an all time great corner

1971-Jack Ham, I believe he is the greatest coverage OLB ever and one of the most versatile ever

1972-hall of fame running back Franco Harris is drafted and becomes one of the best of his time.

1973-solid corner J.T. Thomas

1974- probably the greatest draft of all time. They take 2 hall of fame wide receivers in Lynn Swan and John Stallworth, a top 5 MLB all time in Jack Lambert, and maybe the greatest center ever in Mike Webster. Oh, and they signed hall of fame safety donnie shell as a UDFA

And along the way many pro bowl caliber players. All of thus ked to the 1979 steelers. The only superbowl champions ever to have a team completely made up of people who have never played for another team. Not a single player on the roster had ever played for another team in 1979.",Steelers GOAT drafting run in the 70s

He also has more Super Bowl appearances (ten) than any franchise except New England (which has eleven, nine with Brady and two without; next in line are Pittsburgh and Denver with eight each). Which must mean that his three Super Bowl losses also outrank most franchises, so let‚Äôs run the numbers on that.

There are eight teams that have never lost a Super Bowl: the Ravens, Buccaneers, Jets, Saints, Browns, Lions, Jaguars, and Texans. (The Ravens and Bucs have won two each; the Jets and Saints one each; the Browns, Lions, Jaguars, and Texans have never reached the Super Bowl.)

Six teams have lost one Super Bowl: the Chargers, Titans, Packers, Giants, Bears, and Cardinals.

Ten teams have lost two Super Bowls: the Chiefs, 49ers, Falcons, Panthers, Seahawks, Steelers, Colts, Eagles, Raiders, and Washington.

So there are 24 teams (three quarters of the NFL!) that have fewer Super Bowl losses than Brady. 

Brady is tied at three Super Bowl losses with four teams: the Bengals, Rams, Dolphins, and Cowboys.

Only four teams have more Super Bowl losses than Tom Brady: the Bills and Vikings (four each), and the Broncos and Patriots (five each). 

Special bonus point: Brady‚Äôs Super Bowl win percentage (7-3, .700) is bested by only 8 teams: the 49ers (5-2, .714), Steelers (6-2, .750), Giants (4-1, .800), Packers (4-1, .800), Ravens (2-0, 1.000), Buccaneerss (2-0, 1.000), Saints (1-0, 1.000), and (checks notes, wait, that can‚Äôt be right, lol, yes it is) the Jets (1-0, 1.000).",Tom Brady has more Super Bowl losses than a whole lot of franchises

Manning and Rodgers both have relatively the same resume IMO. They‚Äôre arguably the best 2 regular season QBs ever (5 MVPs for Manning, 4 for Rodgers), but get knocked for their lack of post season success for the talent they display.

nfl,"**RB: Miles Sanders, Boston Scott.**

Pretty average but runningbacks are extremely o-line depedenent.

**O-Line: Jordan Mailata, Landon Dickerson, Jason Kelce, Isaac Seumalo, Lane Johnson**

Best o-line in the league arguably.

**WR: Devonta Smith, AJ Brown, Quez Watkins**

Arguably two WR#1s plus Quez is a decent WR3

**TE: Dallas Goedert, JJAW**

Goedert is a top 10 TE and who knows maybe JJAW breaks out as a TE

**D-line: Brandon Graham, Fletcher Cox, Jordan Davis, Derek Barnett**

Just really solid all the way around. Cox is the 2nd best DT of the decade after Donald arguably. Davis is a massive run stuffer high draft pick. Barnett and Graham as a duo has always been solid.

**LB: Haasan Reddick, Kyzir White, Nakobe Dean**

Dean was the best defensive player at Georgia arguably. White is a really underrated LB and honestly better than Devin White. Reddick has been a stud the past year or tow.

**CB: James Bradberry, Darius Slay, Avonte Maddox**

Two elite CBs and Maddox is solid in the slot

**S: Jakarski Tartt, Anthony Harris, Marcus Epps**

Very good deep group even without a super star.","Are the Eagles ""a qb away"" from a Super Bowl?"

nfl,"Salutations Reddit,

Much like most of you, I was longing for any NFL content during this offseason and decided the other day to relive the 2021 season by watching the 2021 top 100 plays on the NFL's youtube account (link below). And that got me thinking of one important question that no one has ever asked: What would a ranking based on just these 100 plays look like? And that is what I set out to do.

My first ranking attempt was to tier the teams based on their net appearances in the video. I wasn't just looking at anything positive for each team, I was also looking at the negatives. For example, the #3 play was Justin Tucker's 66 yard FG against the Lions. Therefore, that play would be a +1 for the Ravens and a -1 for the Lions, and the higher a team's aggregate score was, the higher they would be on the tier list. Finally, each play was treated the same, no matter where it was on the list.

Without further ado, below is the tier list based on the aggregate score of each team (the higher the tier number the better) with a breakdown of the amount of positive and negative plays:

**Score of 4: Philadelphia Eagles-** (5 Positive, 1 Negative), **Chicago Bears-** (4 Positive, 0 Negative)

**Score of 3: Cleveland Browns-** (5 Positive, 2 Negative), **Cincinnati Bengals-** (8 Positive, 5 Negative), **Jacksonville Jaguars-** (4 Positive, 1 Negative), **Los Angeles Rams-** (5 Positive, 2 Negative)

**Score of 2: Buffalo Bills-** (5 Positive, 3 Negative), **Washington Football Team-** (4 Positive, 2 Negative)

**Score of 1: Tennessee Titans-** (5 Positive, 4 Negative), **Kansas City Chiefs-** (6 Positive, 5 Negative), **Miami Dolphins-** (2 Positive, 1 Negative), **Minnesota Vikings-** (3 Positive, 2 Negative), **Tampa Bay Buccaneers-** (3 Positive, 2 Negative), **Detroit Lions-** (3 Positive, 2 Negative)

**Score of 0: Pittsburgh Steelers-** (3 Positive, 3 Negative), **Los Angeles Chargers-** (4 Positive, 4 Negative), **New Orleans Saints-** (1 Positive, 1 Negative)

**Score of -1: Carolina Panthers-** (1 Positive, 2 Negative), **New York Giants-** (1 Positive, 2 Negative), **Seattle Seahawks-** (2 Positive, 3 Negative), **New York Jets-** (2 Positive, 3 Negative), **Dallas Cowboys** (3 Positive, 4 Negative), **San Francisco 49ers** (4 Positive, 5 Negative) 

**Score of -2: Atlanta Falcons-** (1 Positive, 3 Negative), **Indianapolis Colts-** (2 Positive, 4 Negative), **Denver Broncos-** (3 Positive, 5 Negative), **New England Patriots-** (1 Positive, 3 Negative)

**Score of -3: Arizona Cardinals-** (3 Positive, 6 Negative), **Baltimore Ravens-** (4 Positive, 7 Negative), **Green Bay Packers-** (1 Positive, 4 Negative), **Las Vegas Raiders-** (2 Positive, 5 Negative)

**Score of -4: Houston Texans-** (0 Positive, 4 Negative).

I shared this important information with my friends, and surprisingly none of them questioned my sanity. Instead, they gave my another task: create a power rankings based on this system. Now I couldn't think of a way to separate every tie that the teams had, but tried to get as close as I could. To determine this, I looked to twitter for advice and all it gave me was ""RATIO"". And then it clicked.

The next power rankings were determined by taking the ratio of the positive plays to the negative plays. For example, my Cincinnati Bengals has 8 positive and 5 negative plays, giving them a ratio of 8/5 or 1.60. Once again, the higher the number the better for the team. 

Without further ado, the 2021 Power Rankings based on the NFL's Top 100 Plays, and the positive-to-negative ratio of each team:

**1: Chicago Bears - Undefined Ratio**

**2: Philadelphia Eagles - 5.0**

**3: Jacksonville Jaguars - 4.0**

**T4: Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams - 2.5**

**T6: Washington Football Team, Miami Dolphins - 2.0**

**8: Buffalo Bills - 1.67**

**9: Cincinnati Bengals - 1.6**

**T10: Minnesota Vikings, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Detroit Lions - 1.5**

**13: Tennessee Titans - 1.25**

**14: Kansas City Chiefs - 1.2**

**T15: Pittsburgh Steelers, Los Angeles Chargers, New Orleans Saints - 1.0**

**18: San Francisco 49ers - 0.8**

**19: Dallas Cowboys - 0.75**

**T20: Seattle Seahawks, New York Jets - 0.67**

**22: Denver Broncos - 0.6**

**23: Baltimore Ravens - 0.57**

**T24: Carolina Panthers, New York Giants, Indianapolis Colts, Arizona Cardinals - 0.5**

**28: Las Vegas Raiders - 0.4**

**T29: New England Patriots, Atlanta Falcons - 0.33**

**31: Green Bay Packers - 0.25**

**32: Houston Texans - 0.0**

Now is this the most accurate power rankings? Probably not considering the #1 Seed of the NFC is 31st and the team with the 2022 #1 pick is 3rd. But will that stop me from doing this every year and basing my NFL opinions completely around this? Absolutely not.

Today we are just barely dipping our toes into the ranks for the r/NFL Top 100 Players of the 2021 season. Players whose average rank landed them in places 125-101 are the Honorable Mentions.

These players don‚Äôt receive writeups, but are released so you guys know just missed the cut-off. After all the rankers did list out to 125, so it‚Äôs only natural to mention the players who ended up there

#METHODOLOGY

*[Link to more detailed writeup on our methodology](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vdrnzu/rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2021_season_hub_post/)*  
  
* **Step 1:** A [Call to Rankers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/su150z/rnfl_top_100_of_the_2021_season_call_for_rankers/) right after the Super Bowl 
  
* **Step 2:** Rankers from each team nominated players to rank, with a **10 game minimum threshold.** Players are associated with the team they played for in 2021

* **Step 3:** The Grind. We instructed users to tier positions groups into T25, T50, etc based on **2021 regular season play only.** This took several weeks as the rankers tiered each position group and discussed them. There were no individual player threads and no arbitrary position caps. Just questions and rankings.
 
* **Step 4:** Users submitted their own personal **Top 125 lists**. 
   
* **Step 5:** User lists were reviewed by myself, u/mattkud , and u/MikeTysonChicken . The rankers were expected to answer questions about their lists. They were allowed to make any changes to their list, and were not forced to make any changes
  
* **Step 6:** *The Reveal‚Ä¶* where we are now!  
  
And without further ado, here are the players who fell just short of our Top 100 list!

nfl,"Just started getting into NFL through madden and I pulled a Walter Payton card. I never heard of him so I ask my dad Apparently and apparently he was the best player my great grumpa ever saw play. 

So I watch his highlights on YouTube but he doesn‚Äôt seem that good. He doesn‚Äôt shift like kamara and would get worked by Henry. He seems kind soft tbh. 

Is this just like the nba where yeah it‚Äôs cool hakeem scored 100 but it‚Äôs because he played when everyone suck.

What am I missing?
nfl,"Some say poorer owners will fall behind at they can't put enlightening money is escrow to make deals similar to the Watson deal with $200+ million guaranteed. But they have the team as a huge asset which would seem to be sufficient collateral to get a low interest loan for money to put in escrow. Any money in escrow could be invested in something like bonds so the difference between the interest paid and interest gained would be minimal.

Is there something about this that wouldn't work? 

Two threads today caught my eye &amp; I'm combing them. First, how can poorer owners afford to compete with QB money post Watson where do much is guaranteed. Second, team owners using the team as collateral for stadiums. Even if say the owner defaulted in it, it would only be a small minority stake even at $200 million.","Now more guaranteed money is being offered, could owners take out loans with the team as collateral to put the money in escrow?"

However, simply by reputation Peyton is lauded as this incredibly smart quarterback and everyone seems to agree he‚Äôs got the best mind for a quarterback.  Brady also gets praised a ton for his knowledge, but more of he‚Äôs already seen everything because he‚Äôs played so long.

Is Brady‚Äôs smarts more of an experience thing and wasn‚Äôt there in day 1 unlike Peyton? Was Belichick and his scheme more of the catalyst behind this?

nfl,"I'm a bit of an NFL history nerd, and I was recently reading over a list of HOF players that played a good chunk of their careers in the 90's and/or 2000's. I was pretty surprised at some names that I was simply unfamiliar with. This is by no means a knock against these guys, but here are just a few you might not know either:

Randall McDaniel- LG for the Vikings during the 90's. He was an All-Pro 7 times, and was a key piece of the 15-1 team in 1998 that featured MVP candidate Randall Cunningham and rookie Randy Moss. 

Aeneas Williams- A long time corner for the Cardinals in the 90's, Williams was an All-Pro corner on the 2001 Rams team, and was even a Pro-Bowl safety at 35 years old.

Bryant Young- He played over 200 career games on the DL for the 49ers, and won a Super Bowl his rookie year in 1994. The team really struggled later in his career though, and since he wasn't a key piece of their dynasty teams with Montana, Rice, and Young, it feels like there are a lot more memorable 49ers from just before his time.

LeRoy Butler- Not sure how many Packers fans under 30 will recognize this name, but he was an All-Pro safety in their back-to-back Super Bowl appearances in the 90's. I think he's just largely been overshadowed by Brett Favre and Reggie White from those Green Bay teams.

Sam Mills- He spent his first 9 seasons as a middle linebacker on some surprisingly decent Saints teams. He did manage to make 4 Pro Bowls in that time, and was an All-Pro for the Panthers in their 2nd season. But virtually his entire career in New Orleans overlapped with Rickey Jackson who was much more well known.

I know there is someone reading this list thinking ""wow. How did you not know about THAT guy??"", but I'd wager that most of you were surprised to learn about at least one name here.

Who have I (and most other fans) forgotten about here though? Who is your favorite HOF player that anytime you bring them up in conversations, most people just say ""who??""",Who is your favorite HOF player that most people have forgotten about?

WR1‚Äôs are outside guys who make big catches and splashy plays. That‚Äôs seems to be different from standard slot receiver‚Äôs duties.

nfl,"Have you ever laid awake at night, 4am, full blown insomnia, can't sleep because your brain is too preoccupied wondering what would an NFL team made up entirely of players named Jones look like?  Would they win any games?  Could they beat the Jags?  Could they beat Alabama?

Well go back to sleep little one, for I have the answers you seek.  I've constructed a full roster of active Jones.  A few rookies made the squad and I did make some assumptions about position switches, but I believe this squad could win some games.  More at that later.

**The Squad**

* Owner - Jerry Jones - Cowboys
* GM - Stephen Jones - Cowboys Effective GM
* Head Coach - Nick Jones - (Current Assistant Coach to McVay so he was an obvious hire)
* OC - June Jones - Former HC who can help stabilize Nick's coaching room
* DC - Travis Jones - Falcons DL coach, not the rookie DT

**Who would the Jones' Beat?**

* Jaguars - A Chandler and Chris Jones led pashrush would make the game a nightmare for Trevor ""Not Jones"" Lawrence who is also missing his new WR2 Zay 
* Patriots - The Jones stole their QB and 3 other defensive starters.  Good luck winning against the Elite Jones Squad with Brian Hoyer as your QB!
* Browns - We will assume that after Deshaun Watson's suspension the Browns fall apart
* Texans - The Texans will be fielding their actual full team against our All Jones Super Team.  Unfortunately for them, that means they will be fielding their actual full team against our All Jones Super Team.  Easy Dub
* Jets - This will be a tough game, but I could not live with myself if I projected a loss against the Jets, so Mac Jones stays undefeated against the Jets.  
* Giants - Honestly I debated letting the Giants keep Daniel Jones; even if they did I don't think his power alone would help.  But now without him the Giants have no hope of keeping up with the Jones.
* Alabama - Yeah, probably.  It's a college team vs mostly veteran pros.  Let's be real.

What do you think?  Are there any other Jones' worth adding to the squad?",Keeping Up With The Jones: An All Jones Team

Baltimore Ravens: 2011 AFCCG vs Patriots

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, the 2011 Ravens were better then the team the next year that they won the Super Bowl with. Why? They went 12-4 in the regular season, which was enough to earn them a first round bye, something they couldn't do in 2012. After beating the Texans 20-13 in the Divisional round, it was the Ravens turn to go and try to beat the evil empire down in Foxboro. The first quarter was a defensive stalemate, with the only score being a Gostkowski FG. Despite this, both team's offenses got going in the second quarter, scoring 10 points each, with the Pats having a 13-10 advantage at halftime. The Ravens would push further away by having a 20-16 lead at the end of the 3rd quarter, before the Pats scored to make it 23-20 in favor of them. \\With the game winding down, and the ball in the red zone, the Ravens had one last shot at the Super Bowl. After a 9 yard run on 1st-and-10, the Ravens had the ball on 2nd-and-1. Lee Evans then caught the go-ahead TD from Joe Flacco to give the Ravens a 27-23 lead with under a minute left to play. The only issue? He didn't. Sterling Moore punched the ball out, and after an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-1, on 4th-and-1 the Ravens brought out Patriots legend Billy Cundiff to send the game into overtime with a FG. However, Cundiff missed the kick, and the Pats got the ball back, and Brady took one final knee to end the game and advance the Pats to Super Bowl 46 against the Giants, killing the Ravens 2011 season in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mention(s): 2019 Divisional vs Titans.

&amp;#x200B;

Cleveland Browns: 1980 Divisional vs Raiders

&amp;#x200B;

After achieving a 11-5 regular season record, the Browns comfortably took the 2nd seed in the AFC side of the playoffs. After a first round bye, they were ready to play the Raiders in the divisional round, attempting to advance to their first Conference Championship game ever. The game was a defensive stalemate, with the Browns only getting four FG's from Don Cockroft, and the Raiders only getting two TD's, but the 2 TD's were enough to give the Raiders a 2-point lead heading into the Browns final drive of the game. On that final drive, the Browns were at the Oakland 13-yard in the Redzone after an 1-yard run on first down. On second down, Browns QB Brian Sipe was instructed to throw the ball away if nobody was open, with the play being named ""Red Slot Right, Halfback Stay, 88,"". Instead, he attempted to force a pass to his tight end Ozzie Newsome, which was intercepted, advancing the raiders into the AFCCG and killing the Browns 1980 season in the process. What makes this loss even worse, is that the Raiders went on to win that Super Bowl, and Dave Logan was open at the 6-yard line anyways. Also, if Sipe listened to his coaches instructions and threw the ball away like he was told to, they would've still had 2 more chances to get the 1st down, or touchdown, anyways.

Cincinnati Bengals: Super Bowl 56 vs Rams

&amp;#x200B;

In the 2021 off season, nobody had any hopes for the Bengals after they sucked from 2016 onwards. Despite this, they shocked the world going 10-7 and winning the AFC North. When the playoffs started, everyone's hope was lost again however, since the Bengals haven't won a playoff game since 1990. Despite this, they shocked the world by winning 3 playoff games in a row and advancing to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1988. There, they got off to a slow start only scoring a Evan McPherson FG in the 1st quarter, trailing 7-3 at the end of it. In the second and 3rd quarter's they got a TD each, with an extra McPherson FG in the 3rd quarter, while only allowing 3 Matt Gay FG's in that time span, to have a 20-16 lead at the end of the 3rd quarter. Despite having four drives up 20-16, the Bengals couldn't get anything going on any of them, and failed to score any points on all four of them. Stafford would then find Cooper Kupp for a TD, and give the Rams a 23-20 lead with about a minute left. The Bengals final drive would stall out around midfield, after a Burrow sack by Aaron Donald on 4th-and-1, allowing the Rams to win the Super Bowl after Stafford took a few kneel downs.

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mention(s): Super Bowl 16 vs 49ers, Super Bowl 23 vs 49ers.

&amp;#x200B;

Pittsburgh Steelers: 2004 AFCCG vs Patriots

&amp;#x200B;

In 2004, the Steelers dominated the rest of the league, with their only loss being a week 2 loss to their longtime AFC North rival Ravens. After that, the Steelers would win 14 straight games, including a revenge game against the Ravens at home week 16. After a first-round bye, they looked shaky in their Divisonal game against the Jets, but nonetheless they managed to win the game 20-17 in overtime on a Jeff Reed FG after the Jets missed several opportunities, to beat them. They wouldn't be has lucky against the Patriots the following week however, has Brady and company jumped out to a 24-3 lead at halftime. They'd finally pull together a little bit in the 2nd half, scoring 14 points in the 3rd quarter to cut the Pats lead down to one possession. In the 4th quarter, both teams would only score 10 points, which was enough to give the Patriots the win, since they already had the lead going into the fourth quarter. What makes this loss so heartbreaking is just how good the Steelers looked, and how from week 3 onwards they looked like they'd win their 5th Lombardi, all the way until the seemingly ran out of gas when the postseason hit.

[Ranking Every Quarterback who Started but Never Won A Super Bowl](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/qoe7co/ranking_every_quarterback_who_started_but_never/)

Without further adieu, here are my bottom four receivers.

**44. David Givens, 2004 New England Patriots (56 receptions, 874 yards, 3 touchdowns)**

David Givens was a native of the city of Humble, Texas, which is near Houston. He played college football at Notre Dame, where he was primarily used as a running back. He entered the 2002 NFL Draft as a wide receiver, where he was scooped up by the Patriots in the seventh round, 253rd overall. He joined a team that had just won a Super Bowl the year before.

Givens barely saw the field as a rookie, hauling in just 9 receptions on only 15 targets. He had an expanded role in 2003, establishing himself as the second wide receiver on the team behind Deion Branch. In Super Bowl XXXVIII against the Panthers, Givens hauled in a five yard touchdown pass in the second quarter, helping the Patriots narrowly win 32-29. He finished the Super Bowl with a respectable 69 yards on five receptions.

In 2004, despite sharing the receiving room with ostensibly better receivers in Branch and Troy Brown, Givens emerged as Tom Brady‚Äôs favorite target. His 56 receptions and 874 receiving yards were both the most on the team. Givens scored touchdowns in all three postseason games as the Patriots won their second Super Bowl in a row. In the Super Bowl against the Eagles, Givens hauled in 3 receptions for 19 yards, including a four yard touchdown. However, his performance was overshadowed by fellow Patriots receiver Deion Branch, who was named Super Bowl MVP after hauling in 11 catches for 133 yards.

His performance with the Patriots was rewarded when the Titans signed him to a 5 year, $24 million deal prior to the 2006 season. However, his career in Tennessee would end prematurely when he tore his ACL midway through 2006. The injury caused him to miss the entire 2007 season, after which he was released by the Titans and never picked up by another team. He sued the Titans, claiming his injury was caused by the failure of team doctors to test his knee, but the lawsuit was dismissed in 2010.

All in all, Givens spent six seasons in the NFL, and caught 166 passes for 2318 and 12 touchdowns. While you could argue that he would have had a better career if he hadn‚Äôt been injured, he had the shortest and least notable career of any player on this list.

**43. Stephen Baker, 1990 New York Giants (26 catches, 541 yards, 4 touchdowns)**

Stephen Baker ‚ÄúThe Touchdown Maker‚Äù was a Los Angeles native who stayed close to home and played college football at Fresno State. The Giants made him a third round pick in the 1987 draft. Baker was used mainly as a reserve receiver, while Lionel Manuel and Mark Bavaro were the preferred targets of quarterback Phil Simms. His receiving stats from 1987 to 1989 were rather unimpressive. 

However, injuries to Manuel during the 1990 season thrust Baker into the starring role. He split catches rather evenly with Mark Ingram, but finished ahead of him in receiving yards with a rather mediocre 541. Baker contributed with a touchdown in the divisional round, but was held without a catch in the NFC Championship Game, a game the Giants won 15-13 despite failing to score a single touchdown. In Super Bowl XXV against the BIlls, Baker caught 2 passes for 31 yards, one of which was a 14 yard touchdown. The Giants topped the Bills 20-19.

The remaining two seasons of Baker‚Äôs career weren‚Äôt any less mediocre. According to Football Outsiders, Baker had the worst catch rate of any receiver from 1991 to 2011 during the 1992 season, catching only 28% of the balls that were thrown his way. He was let go by the Giants following the 1992 season, and a back injury forced him to retire rather than find a new team.

In 6 NFL seasons, he caught 141 passes for 2587 yards and 21 touchdowns. For a guy nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Touchdown Maker‚Äù, he was never anything better than mediocre.

**42. Charlie Brown, 1982 Washington Redskins (32 receptions, 690 yards, 8 touchdowns)**

Good ol‚Äô Charlie Brown was a South Carolina native who played college football at his home state South Carolina. The Redskins selected him in the eighth round of the 1982 draft. Brown became a contributor immediately as a rookie, outperforming future Hall of Famer Art Monk in the Redskins receiving room. He was named to the Pro Bowl as a rookie, as well as the PFWA All-Rookie team. In Super Bowl XVII against the Dolphins, Brown‚Äôs eight yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter helped seal a 27-17 Redskins victory.

Brown had a career year in 1983, and helped his quarterback Joe Theismann win MVP. He was Washington‚Äôs leading receiver, once again beating out Art Monk for the title. His 1225 yards and 8 touchdowns led him to be named to a second consecutive Pro Bowl. Brown had three catches for 93 yards in Super Bowl XVIII, but it was for naught as the Redskins fell to the Raiders 38-9.

After injuries sidelined him for most of the 1984 season, Brown got into a dispute with head coach Joe Gibbs over his status as a starter, and skipped minicamp in May of 1985. This culminated in a trade that sent him to Atlanta prior to the 1985 season. Brown played three seasons for the Falcons, but never saw the same success he had had in Washington. His best season was 1986, where he caught 918 yards and 4 touchdowns. He retired following the 1987 season.

In an NFL career that lasted only six years, Brown caught 220 passes for 3548 yards and 25 touchdowns. While he had two great seasons that led to two Pro Bowl appearances, he was mediocre for the rest and his short career doesn‚Äôt help him.

**41. Willie Gault, 1985 Chicago Bears (33 receptions, 704 yards, 1 touchdown)**

A Georgia native who played college football at Tennessee, Gault was selected by the Bears 18th overall in the 1983 draft. Gault was a former Olympic sprinter and is still considered one of the fastest NFL players of all time. Nevertheless, Gault proved to be a relatively mediocre NFL receiver and never posted more than 1000 yards in a season his entire career.

Gault‚Äôs most notable season was 1985, when he was the leading receiver on a middling offense that went 15-1 behind an elite defense. While the Bears offense still ran through Walter Payton, who led the team in receptions, Gault was the team leader in receiving yards. In the Bears 46-10 blowout of the Patriots in Super Bowl XX, Gault caught 4 passes for 129 yards.

After spending five seasons with the Bears, Gault was traded to the Raiders prior to the 1988 season and spent the remaining six seasons of his career in LA. His best season was 1990, when he caught 50 passes for 985 yards, helping the Raiders reach the AFC Championship Game. He retired following the 1993 season.

In 11 seasons in the league, Gault caught 333 passes for 6635 yards and 44 touchdowns. While you could argue his results were due to the middling QB play of Jim McMahon and Jay Schroeder, Gault was never anything better than a mediocre receiver.","Ranking the Lead Receiver of Every Super Bowl Winning Team, Part 1: The Basement (44-41)"

- I don‚Äôt give a shit about who has better stats. Stats can be very skewed, misleading and are looked at without context. I‚Äôm looking at ability/talent (explosiveness, speed, size, strength, body flexibility, physicality, twitch)

- Teams &amp; QBs they play with don‚Äôt matter, we‚Äôre supposed to be looking at just the WRs themselves

- I do value the ability to line up on the outside, as well as versatility and the ability to play in most/all offensive systems (which pretty much goes along with talent level)

- Technique &amp; nuances are important, but not as much as raw physical ability 

- Rookies not included 

- Last but not least, this is all just my opinion and I don‚Äôt have any hate or bias towards any player.

nfl,"I initially started this as a comment to an Alex Rollins video. Then it kinda just kept going and I figured I'd make it its own post cause it was so long. The premise is... Russell Wilson is great but flawed and has a very distinct play style and is really hesitant to play outside of that style. I've loved watching him play for a decade in Seattle and I have a lot of takes on him and his play. I'm gonna dump all of my thoughts here. Any nerds here this is for you... So buckle up. 

First I'd like to say, I think Russ is a shoe in for the HoF. It has been way more good than bad with him. He's been downright special. With that said, I will try to share where I think he is as of right now as honestly as I can. A bit of this will be based on his whole career. But I will weight recent seasons as I think there has been a clear crystallization of his abilities, style, and personality now. We've seen the fully formed Russ Bot over the past few seasons. Distinctly different from younger Russ, but he's been this way for a large enough sample size to say this is the way he is. 

I will try to give my analysis of him as a player at this point. I'll break it down into some key categories with regard to his game. I will also touch on some of the personality/culture/off field stuff as well (a hot button issue on Seahawks reddit lol) 

His play: 

- Football IQ - He is very smart. He understands the game of football and the QB position with the best of them. He can read a defense pre snap to make adjustments and assess opportunities as well as pretty much any QB I've seen. Russ's alert game is just incredible (more on that later). His WR can run complicated options and he knows where they'll be and when they'll be there. To be honest the mental talents he brings to the position are very underrated. Stories of his study habits are legendary. And like all great QBs he brings his guys into that study. He will push his WRs to work just as hard as him at studying tape. That helps to build a common understanding and builds trust. Again, just like Brady, just like Rodgers, like Manning, any great QB... Trust is a huge part of his game. He knows what the defense is doing. He needs you to know it too. 

Processing - not only is he able to observe what the defense is going to throw at him pre snap, he also has snap decision making during the play. We all know the Russ drill... Scramble for 8 seconds dodging MFers like he's football Houdini only to connect with Lockett, DK (admittedly less so on these... More on that later), or Dougie Baldwin for a 20 yard dart toe tap catch along the sidelines or a 40 yard moon ball that drops right into the bread basket. Again, the stuff of legend haha. This simply isn't possible without basically a super computer automating decisions to throw the ball. He can simultaneously evade multiple rushers while scanning the field to find a man that has even the tiniest of advantages and get it to them in the smallest itty bittiest little window for a positive play. I'll make further notes about running through progressions later, but in brief he can go through his reads easily and with appropriate timing to find open guys consistently. Something we talk more about with rookies... Can they do it or not. We expect it from vets. But just worth mentioning. 


- Escapeability - so... As for the Houdini routine. Trying to sack young Russ was like trying to bring down this mystical creature. Imagine, mist, butter, and honey badger were bred together. That was basically Russ. He had elusiveness, quickness, and very underrated strength. He's a stout guy with great speed. He has went away from that a bit in recent years though. He is not quite so amazing athletically. He's still high up there in the league. Don't get me wrong. But, it's not quite what it used to be. I would say that loss of athleticism though is probably a smaller part of what has made him less ""magical"" while evading sacks. A big part of it is that it's been coached out of him. He has had coaches that have worked him into a more normal QB. Namely, Brian Schottenheimer. For good reason I might add as this is going to help him be more of a long term sustainable talent. He still has the ability and the tendency at probably an above league average. But it's not quite what it used to be. He doesn't rely on it as much... Though it is still certainly a feature of his game. His rushing yards are down. And eye test says he's not as quick or as slippery as he once was. Still able to break tackles, but not like when he was younger and you figured the guy running straight at him unblocked was somehow going to get embarrassed. He's gone down on those more than he used to from what I see and feel. Maybe stats don't back that up... Haven't checked. But my gut says it's so haha. 

*Super long winded section be prepared, but I feel this is a very important part of his game at this point* 

- Tendencies - Russ has clear tendencies. He likes to play a certain way. He likes to throw to certain types of receivers. He likes to throw to certain locations. I think he may be one of the more predictable QBs in the league. You can figure out what he likes to do and play against it. 

Granted he's got great IQ, processing, and athletic ability so he's going to make it hard to stop him anyway. He basically plays a game of... I know, I know you know, you know I know you know but what are you gonna do about it? He uses his traits to allow him to make plays and make throws that he wants to make. I want to discuss this a bit more in a later section, but I want to echo what was said in the Alex Rollins video recently... Russ plays Russ ball. 

He will throw outside of the hashes a lot. Almost exclusively. It's been a talking point in Seahawks land for a while. All of the astute observers have been saying this over and over. Meanwhile some have looked at passing charts seen him throw over the middle like four times and one game and shouted SEeeEeeEEEEE!!!???? HE DOeeeessssSSS throw over the middle. In reality, look at his heat maps as compared to the rest of the league... He doesn't. He simply doesn't do it. He's throwing outside the hashes at a very high rate and in the middle at a very low rate. We can speculate a bit about why that is... I'd rather not... Cause who knows for real other than him. Some say he's short. I think it's just about what he thinks is the best/safest way to play. But the truth is he doesn't utilize that part of the field. 

Remember his amazing escapeability? What did he use that for? He used it to buy time to throw to a location he wanted to throw to. It would be a window along the sidelines or a bomb down the sidelines. He just feels more comfortable throwing to the sides of the field. You can watch him on these Houdini plays miss plenty (PLENTY) of open guys in the middle of the field. To make a ridiculously low percentage... Gotta get in the exact... Can't miss by .01% here... Spots. His game has been predicted on letting him make the throws he wants to make. Now I worry, as I'm assuming the hawks have, that even a tiny dip in athleticism and talent could be disastrous considering this fact. He lives in the margins. He plays a low percentage game and consistently overcomes the odds cause he's f****** better than you. But that only works so long as he's better than you. We have seen some slippage. It could be cause his heart wasn't in it as much (a point later) or it could be some decline due to his age, his hits taken, Mr. 'Only Defeated By Tom Brady' Father Time. Don't know. Again only he could know. 

He also likes certain types of receivers. He loved Doug. He loved Lockett. He has underutilized DK. He made you look at your fantasy football FA list and be like... Wait... Should I add David Moore or Freddie Swain? He likes smaller guys that can work into his scramble drill. He likes guys that play with quickness. He likes guys that are crafty. He also likes downfield threats. Tyler is probably the best example of this. Sure hands. He can trust him. They have mind meld. Did you get into the league because you have ungaurdable athletic traits or because you're crafty and work hard? DK has done as well as he has because he can get open downfield and Russ loves deep shots. However, he has really struggled when trying to use DK as something other than that. DKs catch rate is not what it should be. Part of that is on him. Also, part of that is Russ not throwing him catchable balls in ways that make sense given his traits. The past two years there have also been just a higher percentage of Russ's 'bad throws' have seemed to have been DKs way... Maybe coincidence, but I don't think so. He's loved Tyler more cause he plays hard through the whole play, has good hands, and make things happen along the sidelines (take a look at Tyler's YAC... It was a whole discussion point at one point and there are lots of hawks blogs and sites that deep dived this topic). 

For any fantasy football people out there... Don't sleep on KJ Hamler. He fits the mold of a Russ receiver really we'll see if he's healthy or not. He's not likely to have the rapport that Russ wants as he missed OTAs, training camp, and maybe preseason. But just keep an eye on him as the season progresses. Fade Albert O. Sutton will likely be boom or bust. Jeudy will benefit from Russ being there. 

One final note on his tendencies... He holds onto the ball a long time. Seriously, every year he's near the top of the league in seconds to throw. Or bottom depending on how you view that stat. He causes more sacks than most QBs. Seahawks line has been trashed for years. But Russ actually is a big part of this problem. Look at the past few years... Hawks line gas actually been about league average. But he makes their job harder. He is one of the most difficult QBs in the league to block for. The rusher in front of you knows Russ will hold the ball a long time. And you as the blocker don't know where in the pocket Russ will be. He makes it hard. Seriously guys... If you know your QB will throw late and you don't know where he's at and you've got a guy like Aaron Donald coming at you who can see exactly where Russ is, it's almost impossible! He will take sacks in Denver. The media narrative WILL be ""if only their line could block a little better"" we will hear this I'll bet my life on it. Denver fans will have moments of being disgruntled. It's not always the lines fault. Sometimes it is. But sometimes it's Russ's fault. Just understand that. 

- a few random traits analysis - Russ has ridiculous arm talent. He can hit deep balls with the best ever. He has great accuracy. He has accuracy in the pocket and on the move. I don't feel the need to say much about this as I think we are all well aware. And I think that part of his game is more sticky. He's had good arm strength. He's had great accuracy. He'll have that probably for the duration of his next contract. Maybe it slips... But that hasn't been an issue yet (outside of his few games back this last year with a broken finger). These are traits that don't fade all that much. Or if they do they just oscillate more than disappear. If he loses some zip on his fastball, he'll probably be able to compensate with his great accuracy. My only concern here is with my statements before that he has predicated his style on a baseline of athleticism that's allowed him to live in the margins. His arm will only be an issue if he has decision making problems. Which will only be an issue if he maintains his tendencies in the midst of athleticism dips. 

Another thing to note... He hates turning the ball over. He's been really good at that. Part because of his tendencies (middle of the field is more risky and he favors WR that he trusts). Part is also his arm talent. Part is his IQ and processing. I expect this to continue. 

*Russ the man, not the player SERIOUS trigger warning... Potential flame war in the comments* 

There are a few things I think are necessary to say about Russ the man. Russ off the field, on the sidelines, and in the locker room. I want to preface with I think he's done a lot in and around the city of Seattle and for the community of Seattle. But there are some caveats worth mentioning. I will also say actions speak louder than words and his actions are highlights. 

- in the community and as a team cultural figure - Russ is a guy that loves the community of the team he plays for. I'm pretty certain of this. He will give back to the community. His trips to the children's hospital are heart warming. He loves kids and clearly wants to make kids who are suffering have a better life. There will be plenty of videos online of him visiting kids with all kinds of health problems and just trying to brighten their day. He prides himself on being a good Christian man. Some may scoff at that in a way. But honestly his actions mean a lot to a lot of people. He seems to genuinely want to be a positive role model and use his platform for spreading positivity in the world and inspire kids to be better people. I am not a religious person myself. But, how he tries to emulate the principles of a true Christian are at the very least very respectable. 

Now, the caveat... His whole thing... His whole persona... what he does can come off as disingenuous. I am not saying it is disingenuous. But, it can come off that way. Compare him to Marshawn and what he does... It's not exactly the same. Shawn would famously do stuff like get a three wheel scooter (motorcycle? Or something lol) and ride around the neighborhood handing out turkeys on Thanksgiving WITH NO CAMERAS. He'd get filmed because holy shit Marshawn is just out here giving free turkeys rn. But his intentions seemed totally pure. Authentic. Russ will have the whole thing filmed. He's not necessarily going out and doing what he does for no credit. He will be trying to take credit for his actions. Again, I want to be super SUPER clear here... I am not saying he's doing it only for his image... But people will see it that way at times. People will be able to read into it that way. He will come across as fake to some. At times even his own teammates will see him as fake. 

For example, the preseason footage of him practicing his 'Let's Ride' video leaked where you can see him trying out different ways of saying it for the jumbo-tron. Or if you watched his preseason hype videos with Jeudy and Sutton... He was clearly code switching. I'm not saying he is fake. But I'm telling you... Some guys are going to see him that way. And as long as he plays well it'll probably not be a problem. But if there's any slippage some will turn on him. It has happened a lot of times in Seattle. The raw, authentic guys have not gotten on well with Russ. The wholesome dudes have loved and respected him. The guys that value authenticity and toughness haven't. Doug didn't like Russ. Sherm didn't like Russ. Golden Tate.... Well that's a whole other thing hahaha. But... His personality and persona will not fit with everyone. He's fairly polarizing in a locker room. Can't make this clear enough, I'm not saying he's a bad guy or inauthentic. But he will have teammates that see him that way. I'm probably 60/40. His actions are high caliber. His intentions might be self interest. It's possible. 

As for on the sidelines, in the locker rooms, etc. He will lead by example. He works hard. He studies hard. He expects the same out of you. He'll grind tape. He'll write up scouting reports. He'll share what he's learned. He'll work on his craft and his body every day. This s*** is important to him. He wants to be great. He wants to win. He also wants to get credit for all that as well. 

He has learned, partly from Uncle Pete I believe, the value of a 'neutral mindset'. Play every down like it's its own down. Approach every game like it's its own game. He's had mindfulness coaches (close friend of his that past away... Was really hard on him) and has really tried to put into practice having a mindset of never too high, never too low. Always compete. That will resonate with coaches and players on his team. Guys will respect what he puts into winning. No doubt. 

How he gets along with staff and other players on a philosophical basis... This one is interesting. While he does preach being neutral. While he does preach the always compete mantra. He does feel as though he deserves a seat at the decision table for scheme and personnel. He does this the roster should be constructed to suit him. Right or wrong. He will campwfor certain guys to be picked up. He'll mandate targets to certain guys (whether in the planning process or de facto in games). He knows what he likes. He likes what he likes. He isn't necessarily the most open minded, team concept guy. He may even have a bit of thin skin under that neutral persona exterior. 

I have already mentioned his tendencies with WR. He likes what he likes there. I have mentioned his tendencies with holding the ball. He will put pressure on his line. He did also throw them under the buss before. I don't think that's necessarily an intrinsic thing with him. But it is worth mentioning. That he was part of the problem. His style has been a part of the reason he got hit as much as he did. He took one, and only one, chance to deflect blame and place it on his line very publicly. 

Despite having different OCs with different goals in mind when they came in... He played the way he wanted to play. To this point one could argue... Maybe that's because of Pete. I'd say... Go watch Tarvaris Jackson (RIP) and Geno Smith under Pete. Different styles. Different heat maps. The types of defensive schemes are changing. The types of players they're looking for along the line and defensively have changed in some ways. The whole storyline when the hawks brought in Shane Waldron was we we're going to see aspects of Shanahan/McVay offenses. That did happen... With the run game. That did not happen with the passing game. Cause Russ is the final decision maker in the passing game. Not to say Russ is right or wrong. Just saying. He's gonna play it his way. And as Hawks fans we blamed the OCs for a while. Until we saw that each ended with the same results. 

Russ was also likely impacted by his feelings towards the scheme and coaching staff over the past few years. There were a few real defining moments. The Butler pick, the playoff loss to Dallas, and whatever happened against the Cards in 2020. The Butler pick cause a fissure in the locker room. Certain important figures in the locker room thought they were making the team Russ's team. Russ thought he deserved that. Some other guys didn't. The Dallas playoff loss was the moment when we saw the coaching staff question Russ's ability to be the guy that could take them to the promise land. By the three pick Cards game... Russ looked confused, lost, despondent, and questioning whether the hawks would ever fully turn over the franchise to him the way that he wanted. 

Another note. Russ took it personally when the front office looked into other QBs. You can argue... You've got a HoFer at QB... Why would you even do that? But this team has an always compete philosophy. He heard they looked into Mahomes and would have drafted him. He heard that they entertained trading him to go get Josh Allen. That bothered him. Those things absolutely absolutely affected the relationship between Russ and PCJS. This same philosophy directly led to them drafting Russ in round 3 and turning over the position to him as a rookie and eventually building the franchise around him as a vet. It seems like he wants credit for the player he is. Why did Tom Brady leave NE? What did he think when Brady left and the Bucs ensured the situation fit Brady? 

The Seahawks, at times despite the narrative, are a well run, thoughtful organization. They scout well. They scout internally really well. They develop well. They are very intentional. They got to a point where they felt Russ's flaws were bound to outpace his cost. They felt the relationship was beyond repair. They pulled the trigger on dealing him. Russ wanted out for a variety of factors. Mostly to be on himself. We'll see who is right in the future. Ultimately, I think it was probably the right move for both considering the hawks situation, Russ's age, and the future path/development arch both wanted to pursue. 

tldr: Russ has been really good, has clear flaws, a bit of an unclear aging curve, we've seen slippage with Russ but we don't know how much was connected to ability or team situation.",Hawks fan final thoughts on Russ as we start anew

nfl,"Both of these things are egregious failures by the sports media and voters.

T.O not being first ballot for being a ""bad guy"" despite being in the top 3 in like every stat was absolutely awful and biased.

Aaron Rodgers winning MVP last year despite not being top 10 in really anything was also awful. They used the argument ""If he played this much, he'd be on pace for MVP numbers"" while ignoring two guys who DID have MVP numbers (Brady and Kupp).

It also doesn't even add up since Rodgers was only averaging 250ish yards per game. To assume that if he threw as many times as Brady he'd surpass him is not a reason to give away a trophy. Brady had over 1000 more yards, more TDs, and his offense was far better and scored more points. They also didn't get exposed in the playoffs.

The Packers were not even top 10 in offense last season and even though Rodgers had a great season, he was FAR behind Brady in pretty much everything. A season where the Bucs had no run game at all, too.

Cooper Kupp won the TRIPLE CROWN in receiving stats and was barely even considered. I think he should have won it, honestly. But it should have definitely been TB over Rodgers if it's the best QB award.

To me, it's still T.O even though I believe both were absolute bullshit. T.O. deserved better, there is at least some argument (tho it's a bad one) that Rodgers deserved MVP","Which was worse, T.O. not being a first ballot HoF or Aaron Rodgers winning MVP last season"

nfl,"The USFL just made an interesting rule change where it's two worst teams (who happen to be facing each other this weekend) will compete for the first overall pick in next year's USFL draft. The rule was made to deincentivise tanking.

This rule could be brought to the NFL and it would solve the tanking problem, making games more enjoyable. The best team to miss the play-offs would get the first overall pick while the worst team will get the pick just before the playoff team's picks, so pick 18.

It could also make the draft itself more interesting. As usually, with the exception of this year's draft, quarterbacks always go first overall, but a team that goes 8-9 or 9-8 and just miss a playoff spot might already be set a QB, so the 1st overall pick could be anyone. 

What do you all think?",What if the best non-playoff team got the 1st overall pick instead of the worst?

&amp;#x200B;

Chicago Bears: 2010 NFFCG vs Packers

&amp;#x200B;

The 2010 bears were a good NFL team. They went 11-5 in the regular season, only losing to the Giants, Seahawks, Commanders, Pats, and Packers. In the Green Bay game, they benched most of their starters anyways, so they really only had two bad loses to the Hawks and the Commanders, since the Giants and Pats both looked like contenders anyways. After a first round by, they got revenge against the Seahawks, in the NFFCG the Pack was able to pull away having a 14-0 lead at the beginning of the 4th quarter. Despite Cutler being injured at the end of the 3rd quarter, they were able to get on the board in the first quarter, trailing by a single TD, 14-7 before big B.J. Raji returned an interception 18 yards for a TD. Following that the Bears scored again, and got the ball back, but it was all for nothing has the Packers Sam Shields picked off a pass from the Bears QB, Caleb Hanie, to secure a 21-14 win. What makes this loss so heartbreaking is the fact that it was to their biggest rival, and the Bears haven't been able to get back their, or win a playoff game since.

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mention(s): Super bowl 41 vs Colts, 2018 Wild Card game vs Eagles (Double Doink).

&amp;#x200B;

Detroit Lions: 2014 Wild Card game vs Cowboys

&amp;#x200B;

The Lions have never really been that good in the post Super Bowl era, and have never really had a chance to get their Lombardi. That all changed in 2014, with Matt Stafford finally having the elite WR he needed in Calvin Johnson. They continued to look competent in their Wild Card game vs the Cowboys too. However, in the 4th quarter, has the Lions were attempting a game winning drive, up 20-17, the Cowboys committed a Pass Interference penalty while the Lions were on 3rd down, which would've given the Lions first down at around the Dallas 30 yard line. However, the referee, Pete Morelli, inexplicably picked up the flag after he threw it. The Cowboys therefore got the ball, and had a game winning drive themselves, to win the game 24-20, and take the thunder from the Lions. What makes this loss sting even more, is that the Lions only have one playoff win in the Super Bowl era, and that the Lions barely even get these types of chances, because of how bad they are most seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mention(s): I have no idea, I feel like Lions fans just expect to lose in the playoffs at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Green Bay Packers: 2014 NFCCG vs Seahawks

&amp;#x200B;

In 2014, the Packers looked like they could contend for the Super Bowl again. Rodgers looked even better then he ever did before coming off of his 2013 injury. After compiling a 12-4 regular season record and a Wild card bye, the future MVP would lead his team to a controversial, 26-21 win over Dallas in the Divisonal round. After a dominating three quarters against the Seahawks in the NFFCG, leading 19-7, with only 5 minutes left in the game, the Packers stuttered. After allowing a TD drive to cut the lead to 5 (19-14), all the Packers needed to do to secure their Super Bowl trip vs New England was recover the onside kick. However, Brandon Bostick, who was supposed to block for Nelson, who was supposed to recover the onside kick, then inexplicably jumped in front of Jordy Nelson, who was likely going to catch the onside kick and secure the Pack's Super Bowl trip vs the Patriots, to try to catch it himself. Bostick then dropped the ball, and it fell right into the hands of Matthews, the Hawks then scored again and converted on a Hail Mary 2-point conversion from Wilson, to lead 22-19. The Packers were able to force OT with a Crosby field goal, but that would be the last time they saw the ball in the 2014 season, since the Seahawks would win the overtime coin toss and Wilson would then eventually find Kearse for a TD to win the game, 28-22.

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mention(s): 2009 Wild Card vs Cardinals, 2016 Divisional vs Cardinals.

&amp;#x200B;

Minnesota Vikings: 1998 NFFCG vs Falcons

&amp;#x200B;

The Vikings were dominant while looking for their first Lombardi in 1998. In fact, they nearly went undefeated with their only loss of the whole year being a 27-24 loss to the Bucs in week 9. Of course, a rookie named Randy Moss helped them a lot here. However, after a first round bye and a Divisional win vs Cardinals, in the NFFCG round against the Falcons, after putting together a 20-7 lead, their offense looked mortal for the rest of the game. Towards the end of regulation however, things looked promising has Gary Anderson, somebody who never missed a FG or extra point all season, lined up to kick. However, he missed the kick and the Falcons were able to tie the game up, 27-27. After winning the OT coin toss, the Vikings couldn't do anything however neither could the Falcons. Once more, the Vikings failed to score on their second OT drive, but this time, the Falcons could score to upset the Vikings 30-27, and end their magnificent 1998 season.

If I were the owner I would have pushed hard for the Washington Fathers. A few reasons why I think this would have been the perfect name:

2) Instead of glorifying military generals, why don‚Äôt we glorify those who truly deserve to be glorified like good fathers. Being a good father is something that any man who wants children or a family should aspire to. The team would finally have something that others can look up to!

3) How do you make fun of the team name? First, you‚Äôd be mocking fathers, but also, what would we say? Daddies? Hell I‚Äôd love for people to make fun of my team by calling us the Daddies.

Oh wow, oh my God. This is crazy. What an upset. **Jerry Rice** is the top-ranked wide receiver. This is a surprise, psyche, no it‚Äôs not, because Jerry Rice is famously the best wide receiver of all-time. Get pranked.

Least surprising thing ever, turns out that Jerry Rice was good. Insanely good. He never had a season with a Z-Score below .3842, he had a season finish in the top 150 nine separate times (absolutely, utterly bonkers). The man holds every conceivable record a WR can hold and he was a good No.2 at age 40. Jerry Rice‚Äôs rank is not why you guys came here, because if he was anywhere but at the top this list would legitimately be invalid.

**Don Hutson** is high, VERY high, dangerously close to Jerry, in fact. But there‚Äôs some things that I want you to remember. Don Hutson is not just an old receiver, he‚Äôs not just from some vaguely long time ago. We are not talking about Lance Alworth, Lynn Swann, Fred Biletnikoff or these guys that boomers love to prop up. 

Don Hutson was the *first* wide receiver. He RETIRED in 1945. We are talking about a guy who played in an era where the  most cutting edge, experimental thing that a team could do was to put their quarterback under center.

He played for 11 seasons. He led the league in receiving seven times, and led the league in receiving touchdowns nine times. He also led all players in scrimmage yards and total touchdowns three and seven times, respectively. A receiver doing these things. In the 30‚Äôs and 40‚Äôs, before the fucking Pro Bowl existed. He is the reason why most routes even exist. His 1942 season in which he had 1,215 scrimmage yards and 17 touchdowns in just 11 games is the highest-performing ‚ÄúBest‚Äù score for a single season I‚Äôve calculated so far for any position and it isn‚Äôt close.

It is more impressive for Jerry Rice to do what he did in the era he played in. Absolutely, without a doubt. But Hutson belongs where he is.

**Randy Moss** is perhaps the most talented wide receiver of all time, and almost certainly the best deep threat in NFL history. His career with the Vikings is as silly as it gets and he obviously had the spot in New England of extreme dominance, but his career did have it‚Äôs ups and it‚Äôs downs so he‚Äôs not quite able to get out ahead of Hutson. Wish I could say more, time is running out.

We love **Terrell Owens** down in the Z-Score mines. Let‚Äôs get him in the Hall Of Fame, huh?

Played for a long ass time at a high level, his prime scores are actually pretty great (as we‚Äôll see). T.O. just ruled. Was there ever a player whose public persona was further from his play style (Reggie White?). You‚Äôd think he was the flashiest guy of all time, when really he was a 230-pound YAC receiver who just beat the shit out of people with the ball in his hands?

**Steve Largent**, man, what‚Äôs not to love? Scrappy, deceptive speed, gym rat, first guy in last one out. White guy with good hands. That‚Äôs fucking football, etc. 

Steve never shattered perceptions of how good a WR could be or anything, but he did lead the NFL in receiving twice. Mainly though, it was just the ridiculous consistency. At the time of his retirement in 1989, he had more 1,000 yard receiving seasons than anyone in NFL history (8).

Hats off to you, Steve!

**Larry Fitzgerald**, **Marvin Harrison** and **Cris Carter**, I don‚Äôt need to explain these too awfully much, do I?

**James Lofton** and **Harold Jackson** are definitely the wild cards, with guys like Julio Jones, Calvin Johnson, and Torry Holt finishing just outside the top ten. Lofton makes a little more sense, he was an incredibly productive receiver for a very long time even if it was for a very unremarkable series of Packers teams. Harold Jackson is a bit of an interesting conclusion, but this is a metric that rewards consistently good production over a very long period of time and he supplies that.

But ya‚Äôll want that ‚Äúwhat about my team‚Äù shit, so here you go. Presented with minimal commentary.

We see a lot of the higher ups dominated by some older guys who utterly dominated in certain receiving categories (especially touchdowns). Some will say this presents a flaw in the index and I don‚Äôt disagree, but considering the sample sizes and ridiculous variance in those early years that‚Äôs just how this index is going to return those numbers.

Don Hutson‚Äôs best season is ridiculous, as I‚Äôve mentioned. The difference between the best score of his season and the second-ranked season is the same as the difference between the second-ranked season and the 32nd-ranked season.

Much love to **Cooper Kupp** for still having one of the best seasons despite playing in our current league.

Some will be shocked and/or pissed that **Calvin Johnson‚Äôs** best season is listed as his 2011 instead of his record-breaking 2012, but keep in mind that he only scored 5 TD‚Äôs that year. Though I‚Äôd suggest looking into the Adj. Best Scores in the spreadsheet if you‚Äôre more interested in this.

This is just a an average of a player‚Äôs top five seasons by Best Score.

I hope we‚Äôve established by now why Hutson is gonna be at the top. Rice and Moss are logical successors

**Antonio Brown** is an unfortunate conclusion but I‚Äôll be damned if the dude couldn‚Äôt catch the shit out of the football.

**Lance Alworth** led all receivers in 1,000 yard seasons by a decent margin at the time of HIS retirement, before being supplanted by Largent.

### **Methodology**
***

My general methodology for how I compute this exists in previous posts, so if you‚Äôre interested, look into my post history.

For the specific formulas for wide receivers‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBest‚Äù Score:

=((Receptions*.19)+(ScrimmageYards*.37)+(TotalTDs*.29)+(Y/R*.15))

Adjusted Best Score: 
=(((Targets*0.8)+(Catch%*1.2)/2)*0.20)+(Total TDs*0.26)+(Yards/Target*0.25)+(ScrimmageYards*0.29)

It was the Browns for 2 years but.. yeah.

I'm leaning towards Jaguars or Broncos. I like Lawrence and the fact that they are up and coming. No particular reason for Broncos, just think they'll be a good watch with Wilson.

Any other non-Americans who have a good reason for supporting a particular team?

#METHODOLOGY

Five years ago we made a decision to focus on ranking just the previous season based on feedback. This year we continued that plan and only ranked players based on their performance during the 2021 regular season, since that is an equal baseline for all players. Post Season play was not considered in the rankings which is a continuation from last year per sub feedback. Additionally, despite the increase to a 17 game season the 10 game threshold to be considered was maintained. Here are some more details on the methodology and process for your understanding:   
  
* **Step 1:** Getting the list of representatives. That‚Äôs what we did back in [February](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/su150z/rnfl_top_100_of_the_2021_season_call_for_rankers/). We started with over 100 rankers which led to 49 completed ranking submissions
  
* **Step 2:** We began nominating players who ranker‚Äôs believe should be considered that have played/started a *minimum of 10 regular season games*. Rankers from each of the represented fan bases submitted nominations for their own teams' players. This ended up being 209 players in total. This took about a week or so and was the only player pool for consideration.  

* **Step 3:** The Grind. Once the pool was created, we utilized rankings threads about what tiers each player is in within their position group. Users were to break players into the following tiers for their peers to evaluate: Top 25, Top 50, Top 100, Top 101-125. This is done to give everyone an idea of where each ranker feels a player should be ranked **based on 2021 regular season play only**. This is an important distinction; if we were to rank players using past performance while projecting their standing heading into the 2022 season, the context would be completely different. Do you think a player who had a down year in 2021 will bounce back to the top tier player he‚Äôs been? I‚Äôd probably agree. However, that‚Äôs not what users were tasked with evaluating. Furthermore, we did this by positional grouping in individual threads; standard positional breakdown was QB, RB, WR, TE, OT, OG, OC, Interior Defensive Linemen (IDL), EDGE Rushers (EDGE), Off-Ball Linebackers (LB), Safety (SAF), CB. If most users have a player in Tier III (Top 100), for example, while someone has him unranked while another has him in Tier I, we‚Äôll be able to find out why they are such outliers publicly. This took roughly 2 months, because we want everyone to have a thorough discussion of any questions they may have. It also helps individual rankers visualize where players should land on their own personal lists prior to submitting. It also helps prevent any funny business.  
  
***NOTE 1:*** There were **no** individual player threads submitted by users discussing the merits of players for or against their placement on the list. Users were also **required** to complete roughly 80% of these tiers prior to submitting their own lists for the overall average. There were breaks built into the process to allow everyone time to do the work and catch up (if necessary) but inactive users were removed periodically. Hence the difference in the total number of people from the start of the process and the total number of submitted sheets.  
  
***NOTE 2:*** No ranker was forced or encouraged to rank a certain number/limited number of positions on their list based on some arbitrary formula or idea. For example, NO ONE was told they need to limit the number of QBs on their Top 100 list. No ranker was directed to ignore any positional value; users were encouraged to factor positional value as they saw it into their rankings since it is a largely subjective measure.    

* **Step 4:** After discussions were completed, the remaining users submitted their own, personal **Top 125 list**. Ranking 125 players was done to get a more accurate and fair average, especially towards the bottom end of the list where rankings tend to wildly fluctuate. Users were given over a week to complete their list.  
  
***NOTE 1:*** Rankings are submitted via individual Google Sheets and auto-compiled into a master list. We reviewed each list for outliers with the help of former rankers to catch individual ranks that are far off the players calculated mean, whether intentionally or accidentally. We calculated a mean rank then the standard deviation for each player. After that, we **automatically** flagged all ranks outside 1 standard deviation to ensure I caught user submission errors using built-in Google Sheets conditional formatting functions. We also flagged ranks **2 standard deviations or more** from the mean to ensure rankers intent with their own list. This was done to ensure flags were identified **with as little bias as possible.** Conditional Formatting formulas were used to highlight cells to verify automatically to remove subjectivity. Users then had the opportunity to correct any submission errors found prior to finishing the list. We used 1 standard deviation *in addition** to 2 since some players had large standard deviations and I wanted to be certain I caught actual mistakes. Rankers were only required to justify ranks 2 standard deviations from the players mean; the keyword here being justify as they weren‚Äôt directed to correct them. The entire spirit of this list is to take several individual rankings and find an average. 
  
***NOTE 2:*** *All rankings will be made public*. That may obviously bring some unwanted heat. But we don‚Äôt believe in skirting transparency for convenience sake. This was made known in the Call for Rankers and during the ranking process. This sub will only see the ranks for each post during the reveal. The final post - The Post Mortem - after all reveals will have a data dump with all ranks, individual sheets, and outlier ranking data made available.  
  
* **Step 5:** With all rankings submitted and corrections made, if any, users lists were locked and their submissions finalized **as their own**. We then calculated an average rank as noted above. Unranked players were designated with a rank of 140 to tabulate the average for all nominated players. Additionally, **one high rank and one low rank were removed** from each player's tally to calculate the average rank. Players ranked 101-125 in the average will make the Honorable Mentions list while the remaining 1-100 will be the ranked players.  
  
* **Step 6:** *The Reveal‚Ä¶* where we are now!  
  
After a combined 6 years of ranking and running the show u/MikeTysonChicken has decided to retire from the process, handing the reigns off to myself and u/mattkud. Mike stayed on to show us how it‚Äôs done and provided invaluable advice and feedback, and we cannot thank him, nor any of the previous showrunners /u/Mister_Jay_Peg ,  u/Staple_Overlord , and u/skepticismissurvival , enough for building a platform that allows us to run this list as thoroughly and efficiently as we did. I‚Äôd also like to thank all the rankers, both the ones that finished the list and event those that didn‚Äôt. Being a year of transition in the showrunning process it might have been a bit turbulent, but they hung with us and had some great discussions and put out a reasonably good final list. Overall they did a great job (except for the ones that mixed up their Josh Allens, they did a slightly worse job.)
 
After three years of ranking myself, I can tell you this is a fun way of spending the offseason regardless of the praise or scorn you get for the list. You get to interact with people and fanbases that you might not otherwise pay attention to, and analyze and watch players who you know only in passing. Sometimes I say the final ranking isn‚Äôt the most important part, it‚Äôs about the journey of rewatching all these great players and having a newfound appreciation for them. I know I‚Äôve become a more knowledgeable football fan since I first signed up to join the list, and I‚Äôm sure most rankers would say the same.

The rankers had a number of strategies for how they ranked the players and each was allowed to follow their own personal guidelines within the given parameters and as long as they were not simply using derivatives of other outside rankings. Basically, *have your own positions and beliefs*. As the reveal progresses, the rankers will have the ability to volunteer their player lists for the revealed numbers and/or where they ranked the listed players as they wish and you are free to engage with them.  
  
**Lastly, players will be revealed on the teams they played/finished the 2021 season with.**

nfl,"2021 was arguably the worst season of Lamar's career.   He was just 7-5 as a starter, the worst winning % of his career, and the Ravens failed to make the playoffs.  He threw a career high in INTs (both absolutely and in terms of rate), his passer rating and QBR were both the lowest since his rookie year, and he took more sacks in absolute terms and per dropback than any season of his career.  He also threw only 16 TDs in 12 games started (the lowest TD% since his rookie year), with 4 of those coming in a single game against the Colts.

Some of this was exacerbated by the atrocious injury situation in the Ravens RB room.  They went from a 40/60 or 45/55 pass/run team previously to passing about 55% of the time in 2021.

With Lamar seeking a new contract and having been absent from OTAs, his agent and PR team are likely working overtime to paint him as a top NFL QB deserving of a massive contract, but is he?   Are we worried about his 2021 performance?  Or do we think he'll bounce back and return to top form in 2022?",Are we worried about Lamar Jackson?
