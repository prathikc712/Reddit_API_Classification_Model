nba,"The James Harden trade, executed early into the 2020-2021 NBA season, at the time was seen as:

(1) a successful attempt by the Nets to bring together an impressive big three and 

(2) a contingency plan to have an additional star due to the wildcard nature of Kyrie Irving. At the time of the trade, Irving had taken a personal leave of absence with ambiguous reasons given to the team and no timetable for his return.

The cost for the James Harden trade was primarily rich in draft assets, including three BKN first round draft picks (2022, 2024 and 2026) and four first round pick swaps (2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027), *all unprotected.*

Present day, Harden is gone, Ben Simmons is in, Kyrie Irving is threatening to force his way out of the team (being the liability that the Nets long had feared), and KD is mulling requesting a trade as well depending on how the Brooklyn front office handles this debacle.

The prospect of losing both these guys would be bad, but not fatal had Brooklyn had control of their draft assets, but Houston are the ones who may enjoy the fruits of Brooklyn’s potential failure.

I think this ends with Brooklyn giving Kyrie the max, as door number two (bad team with no control of your picks) is a lot worse and the Nets know it firsthand.","The Brooklyn Nets were partially motivated to acquire James Harden as “Kyrie insurance.” However, the trade has only compounded a dire situation the Nets now face due to Kyrie Irving."

nba,"I am from Charlotte, lived there my whole life until college, so I have seen it all. The situation we are in currently is scarily similar to our situation a decade ago - stuck in mediocrity. 

There’s one thing I’ve learned from being a hornets fan is that if you are never the worst team but not a playoff team, that is by far and away the worst spot to be in in todays league. Years ago we had a great point guard with solid players around him to be a competitive team, but the peak talent of a first round exit. That’s exactly what we are now. 1 week ago I would’ve said something extremely different, but I have lost all of my confidence in the ownership, FO, and the happiness of our core players.

We made a great move in the draft selecting Mark Williams - great fit and it’s what we have needed for a long time. But what the hell happened at 13? A late first and 4 seconds for a lottery pick. The Wolves got more value at 19 and the Sixers did ten picks after ours as well. Just makes no sense. 

After the Atkinson hire I was very confident in us taking that next step, re-signing a happy to be here Miles Bridges, and possibly make our first playoffs since 2016. That has all shot straight off a cliff now. Clifford in theory is what a zero defense team would need, if they weren’t all 20 year olds. Clifford proved to all of us fans he couldn’t develop a single one of our lottery picks well at all, and I doubt that will change.

I feel bad for LaMelo, Bouk, PJ, Kai, and now Mark too. Miles is most likely gone with Mitch giving the perfect opportunity for Detroit to sign him. I was all in on Mitch being our gm but after this week, I’m simply sickened. I’m making this post as a desperate call for help as this team has lost all sense of direction for our future and it’s truly depressing. My whole life every time we take a step forward we take multiple steps back as soon as we can. What is appealing here for LaMelo to stay for very long? We never seem to take the correct decision for the long run.

At this point we need to strike even more luck than we did two years ago with the third pick. We have dug ourselves a gigantic hole that’s gonna be hard to get out of. Fellow Hornets fans I am sorry, it seems a lot of our hope we gained is disappearing quicker than I could ever imagine.

This is such a lame post I know but I’m just done with this shit we go through every single damn year. I want to give a massive fuck you to the gambler that runs our team, never could be the goat in my eyes. All of the shit the kings get when we’re right there with them.

nba,"Scenario:  Kyrie opts in and tells Nets he won’t play unless he’s traded to the Lakers.  In back-channel convos, Kyrie-Lebron-Pelinka have already discussed a Lebron max extension in August if they add Kyrie, and a Kyrie max offer the following summer.  

Nets trade:  Kyrie and either DayRon Sharpe or Cam Thomas for salary-matching purposes.  They also have to pay Kyrie’s 15% trade kicker.  

Lakers trade:  Westbrook and…everything that isn’t bolted down: 

The better of the Lakers and Chicago’s ‘23 second rounder, and 

‘25 first-round pick swap rights, and 

‘26 first-round pick unprotected, and 

‘27 first-round pick swap rights, and 

‘28 first-round pick unprotected

Nets avoid losing Kyrie for nothing, and instead get two unprotected first rounders and two pick swaps.  They get more expensive, but they get draft assets they can use to package with Westbrook’s expiring if a big-salaried good player shakes loose.  

Lakers feel more confident parting with unprotected long-term first-rounders if they have Lebron’s long-term commitment and Kyrie. 

The Nets cannot afford to lose Kyrie’s salary slot.   Same logic applied to Warriors when KD left.  If your owner is willing to pay that much, you gotta use that cash to help you get better.  And Westbrook’s salary (and the 4-5 draft picks) is an opportunity to get better if you’re a team with an $180M payroll.  Nets could then flip Westbrook later in the summer or at the deadline, presumably to a team looking to add two first rounders and get off bad long-term money.",Draft compensation scenarios for a Kyrie-Westbrook trade next week

&gt; Late in the fourth quarter of Game 4, Warriors coach Steve Kerr pulled a struggling Green from the game, a controversial move that Draymond wasn't thrilled about, but ultimately understood. After Golden State won its fourth championship in eight seasons and celebrated with a parade down Market Street in San Francisco, Kerr joined Andre Iguodala and co-host Evan Turner on the ""Point Forward Podcast,"" where he defended the move. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""I've been here now eight years so I know all these guys so well,"" Kerr said. ""I didn't really think much about it when I took Draymond out in Game 4, because that unit was not doing well so I was really looking for a shift. And I was thinking I would just take him out for a minute or two and then get him back. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""In the NBA if you find a group that works, then you stick with it and it doesn't matter who is on the floor. You can't worry about anybody's feelings being hurt or anything like that. So when that group started to play well, I wasn't paying any attention to the bench, but Andre, you were there and I've heard since that you were there talking to Draymond and I'm sure he was staying ready.

nba,"In Hustle (2022), Kenny Smith plays sports agent Leon Rich. Since he wasn’t present during the Inside the NBA sequence in the film, I believe that Kenny Smith the player does not exist in Hustle’s brach of our infinite multiverse. Since Leon Rich the agent does not mention playing for the Rockets, I believe that there was no Kenny Smith analogous player in the Hustle universe.  Consequently, do the Rockets win their championships if they are missing a critical role player/bus rider in Kenny Smith? 

In the Rockets overall run from 1992-1993 through 1994-1995, Kenny Smith averaged 11.7 points and 4.5 assists in 57 playoff games. He also shot .425 from three point range in that span. 

In my opinion, the biggest what if is in the 1995 finals against the Magic. In Game 1 of that series, Kenny scored 23 points with 7 threes (which was a Finals record at the time). Kenny also made the crucial three that sent Game 1 into overtime. In Game 1, the Magic were up 110-107 in the waning seconds of the game. [Nick Anderson was fouled twice in the closing seconds. He proceeded to miss four consecutive free throws, which gave Kenny Smith the chance to hit a three to tie the game.](https://youtu.be/INt66rnIvSs)If Kenny wasn’t there, maybe the Rockets don’t tie the game and the Magic may have taken Game 1 and had much more confidence in the series. Maybe the dynamics of that series would have gone differently if Kenny wasn’t there to have a clutch Game 1 to help the Rockets win. Or maybe the bus driver in Olajuwon would have gotten a couple bus riders to make up for Kenny’s missing production. 

What do you all think?","Without Kenny Smith in the Hustle (2022) universe, do the Houston Rockets still win their championships in 1993-1994 and 1994-1995?"

Of course, it is hard to determine exactly who the best defender ever is (personally, I think it is Bill Russell) due to the many statistics and variables to consider. To make things slightly easier (but still difficult), I present to you my version of three All-Time All-NBA Defensive Teams:

First Team:

C - Bill Russell
F - Tim Duncan
F - Scottie Pippen
G - Michael Jordan
G - Kobe Bryant

Second Team:

C - Ben Wallace
F - Hakeem Olajuwon
F - Kevin Garnett
G - Dennis Johnson
G - Gary Payton

Third Team:

C - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
F - Dennis Rodman
F - Draymond Green
G - John Havlicek
G - Jason Kidd

Honorable mentions include Dikembe Mutombo, Dwight Howard, Kawhi Leonard (longevity), Giannis Antetokounmpo (longevity), Bobby Jones (remember him?), Alonzo Mourning, Jerry West, Chris Paul, and Sidney Moncrief. There were a lot of centers obviously, which is why I had to make some very difficult, even flexible choices (Olajuwon played PF for a while, by the way).

nba,"**Hypothetical** \- You go to sleep and wake up tomorrow morning inexplicably at a taller height. Your wingspan, etc. stays in proportion with your new body. For example, if you wake up 30% taller, your wingspan also increases 30%. You don't suddenly become any more injury prone than you currently are.

**Question** \- How tall would you have to be to be a rotational player in the NBA this upcoming season?

**My answer** \- I think I would need to be **8'6''**.

Pros on my scouting report - I'm in my 30s and in pretty good shape for my age. I don't have preexisting injuries and I'd desperately want to be a star and wouldn't care much about my stats. I was a slightly above average high school level athlete with pretty good eye hand coordination. I'd be able to contest virtually anything near the paint without having to be in good position. If I learned to receive passes high and not bring the ball down, I'd be literally unguardable. My standing reach would be possibly 12'.

Cons - My athleticism would be literally the worst in the NBA with a vertical leap \~18-20 inches. I'd be last in foot speed and lateral agility. I have no organized basketball experience and am a below average pickup player. I get confused by defensive schemes playing 2k and would still somehow likely be a defensive liability at times. I'd shoot roughly 30%-40% on FT's (if I don't melt down from pressure) and would be prone to Hack-a-Shaq strategies. I'd probably get bullied on the court. I get sore if I work out hard two days in a row and would probably break down within the first few weeks of the season. Load management would likely only allow me to play in select spots. I'm already old.",How tall would you need to be to be a contributor in the NBA right now?

nba,"Just to make it clear, this comes from a KD hater (because he ruined the league for few years) but I'm trying to be as objective as possible.


I understand now that Curry has won without him people are ready to place him higher on all-time lists, accolades also helps, but I think that story needs much more context.


Curry has more rings and more MVP awards and that is enough for a casual viewer, but what if we go deeper.

First of all, when they played together KD was CLEARY the best player on that team, you can argue Steph was more important and back it up with winning rate but numbers, eye-test and 2 FMVP's clearly favors Durant.

Other argument is that Steph has much more playoff success without KD than KD without Steph. Even though Steph showed he can be the main guy on a championship team he had much easier path to his rings, he hasn't beaten any all-time great team without KD (2015 Cavs were injured and 2022 Celtics are good but not on that level). KD had to go against Spurs dinasty, Miami big three and 73-9 Warriors, 3 out of 5 best teams in 21st century. Both had 3-1 chokes in the playoffs so I guess those each cancels out.


And at last, I understand people who put Steph over him, but I also think they shouldn't make their pick too soon, both have case to be above each other and I think it has to be more of a preference as a player than deciding on rings and accolades",Why are people now so easily placing Curry over KD?

nba,"We both know this is top-tier, world-class analytics here. It's so far ahead of its time that nobody has yet invented a meaningless, all-caps statistic \[named after a player\] for it.  Well, as you can tell from my username, I've been working long and hard on this. My brain has been doing XLOOKUPs, ggplot2s, Hadoop-ing, and more - all of it just to create this extremely accurate measurement of future stardom. 

I call it: DEROZAN

DEROZAN measures how likely a player is to achieve stardom simply based on their first and last names. To avoid confusion, ***a*** ***perfect DEROZAN score would mean that the player is a lock to make at least three All-Star appearances as a starter***. Also, DEROZAN is 0-10. Every player immediately starts at 5/10 (your standard name), but loses a point per naming deficiency.   
\- NOTE: A DEROZAN value of 8/10 means the player will at least make the All-Star game one time during their career (whether reserve or starter), and a 9/10 means they'll receive a max contract at least once. 

A player's DEROZAN value is elevated if their name is creative, catchy, unique, consistent in structure, rolls off the tongue easily, and is either very easy to remember or very difficult to remember - no in-between.

A player's DEROZAN value is diminished if their name is generic, too similar to existing players' names, somewhat difficult to pronounce, isn't very catchy, is abbreviated to two letters, is childish-sounding, or has contradictions between the first and last name. 

\---

With the introduction out of the way, let's present the DEROZAN values for the prospects projected to fall in the 2022 NBA Draft Lottery (top 14 picks). This order is only in terms of projected draft placement, *not* in order of DEROZAN:

1. Chet Holmgren - **DEROZAN: 6/10** \- Unique and somewhat easy to pronounce, but the last name is kind of a mess. It doesn't roll off the tongue nicely and isn't very memorable. 
2. Jabari Smith - **DEROZAN**: **5/10** \- This would be unique if we didn't already have a Jabari Parker. Furthermore, the last name couldn't be any more generic than 'Smith.' It is definitely easy to pronounce, though, and is at least somewhat of a memorable name considering he'd be the only relevant Jabari. 
3. Paolo Banchero - **DEROZAN: 8/10** \- Very memorable name and somewhat easy to pronounce. The pronounciation of the last name is bound to be a problem for most Americans (""ban-cherro"" ). Both the first and last name end with an 'o,' so there's a good amount of consistency. With a DEROZAN value of 8/10, Paolo Banchero is guaranteed to make the All-Star game at least once in his career. 
4. Jaden Ivey - **DEROZAN: 8/10** \- Jaden McDaniels is alright,  but not particularly relevant. Thus, Ivey will surely become the most relevant and talked-about Jaden, so his name is relatively unique. Both the first and last name have two syllables, and it's pretty easy to pronounce. 'Ivey' is a unique last name in the NBA landscape. I liken his name to Kyrie Irving, though Kyrie had a DEROZAN value of 9 due to the creativity behind the name 'Kyrie.' 
5. Keegan Murray - **DEROZAN: 6/10** \- This name is somewhat out of the ordinary but it's kind of a generic name nonetheless. There's no sense of personality behind this name, and we've already got a pretty-good Murray in the league. Not much to say, honestly.
6. Bennedict Mathurin - **DEROZAN: 8/10** \- This name is creative, catchy, very unique, and pretty easy to pronounce even for non-native English speakers. Yes, despite the length of the name and unorthodox name choices, someone could roughly piece together how to pronounce this name since there aren't any 'exceptions' or non-standard practices going on here; no silent letters, either. The only knocks on Bennedict's name are that it doesn't roll off the tongue easy and admittedly, seems like it's trying too hard. Despite that, his parents made sure their son will make an All-Star apperance at least once during his lifetime. Kudos to the Mathurin elders.
7. Shaedon Sharpe - **DEROZAN: 9/10** \- Extremely catchy, both the first and last name start with the same letter, short and sweet, rolls off the tongue extremely well, and is very unique and memorable. Furthermore, there's a kind-of 'killer instinct' that seems to emanate from this name. The reason Shaedon doesn't have a 9 is due to the 'e' in Shaedon and the confusion as to whether it's pronounced ""shade in"" or ""shade on."" Whether the shade is in or on probably doesn't matter to Sir Sharpe very much, as he's guaranteed a max contract at least once.
8. Dyson Daniels - **DEROZAN: 7/10 -** In a vacuum, this is a pretty solid name. We have the same first letter make an apperance in both first name and surname, and it's easy to pronounce and remember. However, this is the first name in recent memory where the parents named their child after a company and not a human; real or fake. This name doesn't have the same 'killer' vibe that comes from Shaedon Sharpe or DeMar DeRozan. If anything, the 's' in 'Daniels' is unnecessary. If it was Dyson Daniel, this would be an 8/10 for sure. 
9. Jalen Duren - **DEROZAN: 6/10** \-  This is a unique last name but the whole 'Jalen' and 'Jaden' thing is being very over-used. I realize that Yu-Gi-Oh! GX was very good and even I thought Jaden was an amazing name after having watched it, but I think it's time to move on. The name is relatively easy to pronounce, though, and he does get a point for the last name being completely new. 
10. Jeremy Sochan - **DEROZAN: 7/10** \- Quite a unique last name, and we haven't had a dominant Jeremy in the league. Linsanity was like everyones' teenage 'phase' that happens when they're 12-15, but we don't think about it much thereafter and completely change. However, how do we really 'pronounce' Sochan? ""so chin?"" ""so can?"" ""so kin?"" ""sock in?"" ""sock on?"" This would be a much better name if he wasn't named Jeremy. If his name started with an 's,' he'd immediately be elevated to an 8/10.
11. Johnny Davis - **DEROZAN: 7/10** \- Yes, this is relatively generic; however, we haven't had a Johnny since the Timberwolves passed on drafting Stephen Curry. That mistake was so bad that Mr. Flynn was too embarassed to play, and quit early. So, this is Johnny Davis's time to shine. Yeah, Davis is generic. However, 'Johnny' is super catchy compared to John. It's funny, the simple '-ny' at the end completely elevates this name from a 4/10 to 7/10. Very memorable name.
12. A.J. Griffin - **DEROZAN: 4/10** \-  The first name is abbreviated, and it overall sounds incredibly generic. At least the last name is Griffin instead of something like Brown or White, but... yeah - that's about it.
13. Mark Williams - **DEROZAN: 7/10** \- It's interesting that we have this name right after 'A.J. Griffin,' because you'd think this one should also be 4/10. However, we do not - nor have we had - any memorable 'Mark' in the league. The last name 'Williams' is a pretty safe pick by his elders, because it's not good nor is it bad. It's just kinda there. However, that's fine, because what's boosting Mark's score is the fact that his name is easy to pronounce, is at least slightly catchy, and is somewhat memorable. 
14. Ousmane Dieng - **DEROZAN: 5/10** \- This first name is relatively easy to pronounce, but the last name is kind-of confusing. Is it ""dee yeng?"" ""dee ayng?"" ""jeng\[a\]?"" There's no flavor; no consistency here. We already have a Dieng in the league, and even he suffered the same fate.

nba,"Possession by possession, there are a few defenders who are as bad as Wiggins. When Wiggins contests a shot, opponents have a 56.1 effective field goal percentage; when they are unguarded, they have a 56.4 eFG percentage. Fundamentally, getting a shot up against Andrew Wiggins is the same as getting an open shot.

...

Wiggins’s deficiencies are too many to list quickly, but at root the issue seems to be basic effort. He barely jumps to contest shots, doesn’t run hard to close out, and gets lost watching the ball.

But the truly destructive part of Wiggins’s defense is how much of it there was. In the way that defenders like Draymond Green or an in-his-prime Tony Allen seem to be in all places at all times, challenging seemingly every shot on the floor, Wiggins is omnipresent in his awfulness. He defended the 10th most shots in the league, by far the most by a below-average defender. Most teams do their best to hide their weak defenders, but opponents seek Wiggins out like no other defender in the league.

nba,"We may complain about the shortage of gas and affordable housing, but we've also entered a crisis of a different kind: a shortage of good **sports nicknames.** In a social media world that favors concision, we're falling back on initials way too often.

To remedy that, let's try to dish out some monikers for the incoming draft class and hope it sticks. 

We don't have to go through *every* prospect, because a lot of them come with unique and badass names already: Paolo Banchero, Bennedict Mathurin, Shaedon Sharpe... you don't need a [nickname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_Manhunter) on top of those: it's gilding the lily. Instead, let's focus on some generic names first:

---

**SG Jaden Ivey (Purdue) is...** already a good name on its own, but there's a nickname staring us in the face here. **Poison Ivey.** As a player, Ivey's best attribute is his explosive and lethal burst to the rim, penetrating the defense / immune system like venom. And for all of those who think it's lame to co-opt a name for a female supervillain, we should remember that Kobe Bryant kinda stole ""Black Mamba"" from *Kill Bill.*

---

**SG Dyson Daniels (G-League) is...** a rising prospect who may crack the top 10. Scouts seem to love his intangibles, his frame at 6'8"", and his passing ability. More than anything, they rave about his defense. He averaged 2.2 steals per 36, and projects as a potential elite defender on the perimeter. When it comes to defending the ball, the Australian national wants to [eat your baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghCTZF61ey0) like a **Dingo**. 

---

**SG Johnny Davis (Wisconsin) is...** in most need of a nickname. The sophomore has upside, but it's hard to be an All-Star with a name like Johnny Davis. It's so debilitating, Paul George had to wear ""13"" to come up with a catchy angle. For Davis, we're get lazier than that and default to **Badger.** After all, Davis is a Wisconsin native who went to school there as well. In terms of playing style, this makes some sense as well. Davis is a good scorer (20.8 points per 36) who works his way inside with tenacious energy, averaging 6.7 FTA per 36.

---

**SG Christian Braun (Kansas) is...** a title-winning wing who may be a little underrated given his all-around game and his 6'7"" frame. You wonder whether he's suffering from a stereotype of being a white wing player. But more than anything, the biggest misconception about Braun is his *name.* It's spelled like ""Brawn,"" but he apparently pronounces it like ""Brown.""


---

**PF David Roddy (Colorado State) is...** less well-known of a prospect, but he's an interesting case study. Roddy was one of the most productive players in college, averaging 21-8-3 per 36 for the Rams. Unfortunately for him, he doesn't look the part at 6'6"", 260. He's short. Thick. Squat. **Squatty Roddy**. Hopefully, he'll play well enough to avoid that deforming into ""Squatty Potty.""

---

**C Chet Holmgren (Gonzaga) is...** an incredible and unique talent. His greatest attribute may be his defensive potential given his light feet, his 7'6"" wingspan, and his productivity in college (4.9 blocks per 36.) He's more than a unicorn -- he may be an alien. But fitting for this UFO, the biggest concern is how he *looks.* He's a gangly, awkward looking dude. One medical professional in my family wondered aloud if he had [Marfan syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/marfan-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350782) (characterized by extreme thinness and lanky limbs among others.) We haven't heard any actual concern about that from NBA circles -- with the presumption that Holmgren is hiding his medicals only to dictate his location. It'd be irresponsible to speculate about or joke about a medical condition. *That said,* it would give us our juiciest nickname for the strange-looking, shot-blocking phenom: **Marfan Manhunter.**",[Why So Serious?] Coming up with Nicknames for the New Draft Class

&amp;#x200B;

Paolo Banchero

As we get closer to the draft, I'm starting to see people entertain the idea of Banchero being the best player in the draft more often, but it has been clear cut since Duke's season ended for me. Banchero is 19 years old and listed at 6'10 250 pounds and has to potential to be a 3-level scorer in the NBA. Guys that are his size, with his handle, that are a threat to score from anywhere on the floor are rare like Mr. Clean with hair. He can play bully ball against smaller defenders in the paint, his midrange pull-up is smooth, and his post bag is deep. If he develops a consistent 3 ball, we could be looking at one of the league's next superstars. If I had the #1 pick in this draft, I'd already be on ESPN talking about who I want playing next to Banchero. Banchero is the player that the Orlando Magic should have their sights set on. I could look like a fool in a few years if Banchero flops, but I feel Banchero's ceiling is a cut above every other prospect in this draft. I know Banchero left something to be desired on the defensive end at Duke and Holmgren and Jabari Smith both have better two-way potential, but ultimately this league is about making and creating buckets and I think Banchero's ability to do that will make him a star.

Picking a perfect fit for Banchero is difficult because he would fit on every lottery team. 6'10 250 with fluid ball handling, playmaking, shot making ability and high-level finishing around the rim doesn't just walk into the gym every day. Not a chance in hell he falls out of the top 3. If he does someone will lose their job because of it at some point.

Best Fit: Orlando Magic, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets

Malaki Branham

Malaki Branham was someone I didn't have a huge awareness of before I started researching for this, but I quickly became intrigued by his potential as a scorer next to a high-level playmaker. I always love a 3-level scorer and Branham has the tools be that in the NBA. In his one year at Ohio State, he proved himself to be a good midrange shooter and 3-point shooter. Branham is able to use his length to get by defenders and is a crafty finisher around the rim. He shot well from everywhere on the floor and showed the ability to be a scoring threat off the dribble in the pick &amp; roll. I didn't see him create much offense for others out of that pick &amp; roll but that's ok, he's still 19 years old with plenty of room to develop. Branham's 6'10 wingspan gives him potential to be at least a serviceable defender on opposing guards and smaller wings.

I'd love to see Branham land somewhere with an established star playmaker that can put him in good positions for take and make open jumpers and see what he can develop into as a secondary playmaker. I know he isn't hoping for it but falling out of the lottery to a team more built to win may be a blessing for Branham as he'd be allowed to develop slowly on a team built to win now, much like Moses Moody last year. That would be ideal, but I like him as a prospect no matter where he lands.

Best Fit: New Orleans Pelicans, Oklahoma City Thunder, Minnesota Timberwolves

AJ Griffin

Look I know, 2 Duke guys isn't going to sit well with some of you, but they consistently produce talent so that's just what it is this year. AJ Griffin's elite catch and shoot 3 abilities in college should make him a seamless fit next to any of the NBA's elite playmakers. Giffin has a variety of dribble moves to create space for 3's, midrange J's and he's able to use his size to finish around the rim. Noticing a theme here? Players that look comfortable scoring from anywhere on the floor are the ones I'd want on my team. I'm buying stock on all 3 level scorers. On the offensive end I think he'll be ready to contribute right away, the defensive side is what may hurt his chances at minutes early in his career. 

The perfect fit for Griffin in my eyes would be a team that can afford to let him play early on and develop, but one that won't put too much scoring burden on him from the start. 

Best Fit: Portland Trailblazers, Detroit Pistons, New Orleans Pelicans

nba,"I've been doing these for a while (longer than I'd like to remember) and they go over super well--the last one even netted 8 thumbs up! So here is another round of why, in the midst of lofty expectations of why that late lottery pick your team made is actually the next Danny Granger (he's not), I'll remind you that most players don't reach anywhere near those ambitious potentials. Many players spend two or three years in the league, and then go play overseas for a while. 

With that being said, here's why each of the players who maybe are most likely to go in the lottery will disappoint:

1) Jabari Smith

Yes he should go number one. With that out of the way, what are you getting? Nice shooter who may not do much else, at least for a while. As in, don't expect him to score off the dribble or down low. He'll catch and shoot and probably be pretty good at it, not quite MPJ good but still good. He's not the complete player that Kevin Durant is. Rashard Lewis is probably a better comparison. Austin Daye was tall and could shoot, too, but I'd say that's a bit too harsh.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Chet Holmgren

Don't get the hype on him at all, like at all at all. He'll be a capable help defender due to his length and will pick up some nice blocks, but he's going to get demolished inside by anyone taller than Isaiah Thomas. On offense, he's not a bad shooter but he's not a good shooter either. Honestly, longer Zach Collins with better basketball IQ. Or, Porzingis when he's not particularly accurate from outside.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Paolo Banchero

If he goes to Houston, he won't work with Alperen Sengun, who is actually a pretty good comparable but given what we've seen from Sengun, I think whoever gets him should be very happy if Banchero starts out that well. He's not going to be good on defense, probably at all, and he won't be able to play the against virtually any lineups, but I think the offensive skills are there for him to be solid. Don't get your hopes up--remember that Jahlil Okafor also had tons of offensive skill and didn't pan out.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Jaden Ivey

Ok we'll start out with the bad because it is misanthropic and all: he's not a good shooter. He's not a terrible shooter, like certain recent top guard picks, and he's not even a bad one per se, just not a good one--he's not going to scare teams from outside. De'Aron Fox is a good comparison particularly as a ceiling. And if we're talking of floors, well, maybe Dennis Smith Jr.? 

&amp;#x200B;

5) Keegan Murray

He's not a great shooter, but not a bad one. He will probably hit an open three but not a contested three. He reminds me a bit of Rui Hachimura, effective college player who may not transfer quite as well into the pros.

&amp;#x200B;

6) Shaedon Sharpe

I honestly have no clue if this guy has NBA game or not, and nobody else really does either. He's looked great against very much lesser competition but how will that pan out? Long long ago there was Kedrick Brown who looked dominant against juco players, and had the body and athleticism of a good NBA player, but who didn't pan out.

&amp;#x200B;

7) Bennedict Mathurin

The fact that his threes and free throws actually got worse in his second year is concerning. He sounds a bit like a less athletic Andrew Wiggins--Wiggins of the TWolves era, not the Warriors. My guess is he gets buckets but is not a net positive for his team.

&amp;#x200B;

8) AJ Griffin

If this guy stays healthy he's a 12 year good role player in the NBA--think Royce O'Neal. I wouldn't hope for much more than that, but I also wouldn't pass him up from 5 onward.

&amp;#x200B;

9) Dyson Daniels

Obvious elephant in the room is this guy can't shoot from distance. The free throw shooting isn't awful, so maybe in two or three years he will be a reasonable enough outside shooter but I think you're looking at something closer to a Lonzo Ball trajectory as his ceiling, and Dante Exum as the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

10) Jeremy Sochan

He can't shoot, at all. Below 60% free throws means he's just not going to do anything for you on offense that doesn't involve dunks and putbacks. So unless he turns into Draymond Green, he's going to have to be a small ball center. Think Precious Achiuwa, before he learned how to shoot.

&amp;#x200B;

11) Mark Williams

Honestly there is DeAndre Jordan upside. So there's that. But this is a misanthropic mock draft so I'll just note that he was to some extent a limited minutes guy in college and will certainly be a limited minutes player in the modern NBA, and someone who will get played off the floor in a number of lineups.

&amp;#x200B;

12) Johnny Davis

He's honestly probably a nonfactor offensively. That assist to turnover ratio is not encouraging, nor is the dropoff in three point shooting. The solid free throw shooting suggests his shooting stroke can be salvaged but honestly, he might not have a good feel for the game. I am thinking more along the lines of Kris Dunn.

&amp;#x200B;

13) Jalen Duren

Mitchell Robinson is probably his ceiling. If you get Mitchell Robinson, you're a winner. If you get Lucas Nogueira, well, less so. 

&amp;#x200B;

14) Malaki Branham

He can probably be an effective scorer but defense will be a big problem for him, and it might be enough to keep him from seeing the court. He's longer than say Sam Merrill but especially on defense he doesn't seem to play longer.",2022 NBA Misanthropist Mock Draft: Why (Almost) Every Player will Disappoint You
nba,"WOJ has reported that PHX is looking for SNT deals for Ayton and do not value him at the max.

I'm guessing these are some of the possible trade scenarios.

Detroit - Kelly Olnynk + Stewart + a future protected 1st.

ATL - Capela for Ayton seems easy, but ATL needs to dump significant salary due to the hard cap.

TOR - OG for Ayton would work, but not sure they'll be willing to trade OG.

In 2017 in GQ magazine after they won a championship he said ""Steph Curry is the face of the franchise, and that helps me out, because I don't have to"" 

 “I don't want to have to be the leader. I'm not a leader,"" Durant said. ""I'm bad at saying, ‘Stand behind me and follow me.’ No. I'm one of those guys that's just like, ‘Let's do this shit together. Let's just work everybody together. I don't mind being on the front line with you, but let's come and do it together.’"" 

These are his own words. 

In OKC, Russell Westbrook was acknowledged as the leader of that team. 

Then after leaving Golden State he FOLLOWED Kyrie to Brooklyn. He is the only person in the Nets organization that Kyrie **might** listen to but he decides to say nothing while his franchise is going down in flames. 

KD between the lines is an all-time great player, but he can't rally the troops, he doesn't make his teammates better on the level of Steph Curry does. Last time I checked basketball is a team sport and NBA roster come with 15 players. He doesn't establish a culture, he doesn't care about want to deal with what comes with being a franchise player, and he is obviously insecure about his own legacy. KD has always been over-protected when is the media going to give the LeBron, the Steph, the Giannis treatment.

Insane. “Spida” will still most definitely receive a super max offer from most teams just because he’s built such a strong image as a scorer  even though he has NEVER shot 45% or better from the field in a season while playing terrible defense.

Not only this, but Westbrook’s assists to turnover ratio was 1.87 this season (bad), yet Mitchell’s was 1.76 (worse!!). Everything Westbrook was criticized for, Mitchell did as well yet was still loved. The only thing he’s better at is 3-point shooting and even then he’s average (35%).

&gt;Is Daryl Morey bringing the Houston Rockets East to Philly?

&gt;Morey was the Rockets’ general manager for 13 seasons before being hired as the 76ers president of basketball operation in November 2020.

&gt;Then, in July 2021, former Rockets CEO Tad Brown was hired for the same position of Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment, which oversees the Sixers, New Jersey Devils, and the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J. And Morey acquired former Houston star James Harden in a blockbuster trade from the Brooklyn Nets on Feb. 10.

&gt;Now, the executive is pursuing former Houston power forward P.J. Tucker, league sources confirm. Sources have also said the Sixers are looking to make a three-team trade that could involve Matisse Thybulle and the No. 23 pick to create space. Sources have said the Sixers are attempting to trade Tobias Harris, but they are having a tough time getting teams to take on his lucrative contract.

&gt;But it became public on Monday that Tucker would opt out of his $7.4 million player option for the 2022-23 season with the Miami Heat to become a free agent. Multiple sources have the Sixers intending to offer him a three-year, $30 million contract. Time will tell what will happen. But a source added that there’s mutual interest between Tucker, 37, and the Sixers.

&gt;Things could change before the start of free agency at 6 p.m. on June 30, but league executives believe there’s a good chance Tucker will become a Sixer.

&gt;Right now, the Sixers don’t have the cap space available to sign him for $10 million per season. As a result, they would have to clear space in order to fit in his salary.

&gt;But there has been league-wide chatter recently over the Sixers’ interest in Tucker even though a person close to the Sixers refutes what league sources are saying.

&gt;Teams are not allowed to negotiate with free agents until the start of the free-agency period. Any discussions beforehand is considered tampering.

&gt;The Sixers, however, could try to make some things work with the three-team trade. The Sixers are looking for a third team to help facilitate the trade.

&gt;The Sixers have said they want to keep their core players -- Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, Harris, and Harden -- intact. However, league sources are saying the team is looking for suitors for Harris, who has two years and $76.9 million remaining on his deal.

&gt;Harris, a power forward, could be expendable if the team acquires Tucker. While not ideal, the pairing could work with Harris sliding down to small forward depending on the matchups.

&gt;Tucker would defend the opposing team’s best forward. But Harris being shopped could be more to do with the Sixers wanting to shed his salary as opposed to fit.

&gt;The Sixers are also shopping Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, and Danny Green.

&gt;Despite his age, Tucker is a solid defender who excels at making corner three-pointers. His acquisition would enable Embiid to get his wish.

&gt;Following the Sixers’ second-round loss to the Heat, Embiid talked about his desire to play with someone like Tucker.

&gt;“He’s just physical and he’s tough, and they have a few of those guys,” Embiid said. “Since I’ve been here, I’d be lying if I said we’ve had those types of guys. Nothing against what we have, it’s just the truth. We never have P.J. Tucker. That’s really what I’m trying say.

&gt;“I think physicality, once you get to the playoffs or the later rounds, you need that. You need those games that are really tough.”

&gt;Tucker played 3 1/2 seasons in Houston before being traded to the Milwaukee Bucks on March 19, 2021. He helped the Bucks win the 2021 NBA title before signing with the Heat in free agency last summer.

&gt;Meanwhile, ESPN reported the Phoenix Suns and Sixers are possible suitors for Rockets shooting guard Eric Gordon, who has two years remaining on his contract. The 33-year-old Gordon will make $19.5 million next season and has a non-guaranteed $20.9 million deal in 2023-24.","[Pompey] Sources: Sixers pursuing P.J.

And so at some point, with Steph being this ambassador to how the game will now be played, we're gonna be in a league where everyone on the court is hitting logo 3s with ease.

**Offense:** 

1. Utah Jazz(Round 1) - Lost in 6 to the Mavs, and fell down 2-1 before Luka even returned. 
2. Atlanta Hawks(Round 1) - Lost *badly* to the Heat in 5. Barely had Capela, but'd still lose badly.
3. Milwaukee Bucks(Round 2) - Lost in 7 to the Celtics, and might've won if they had Middleton. 
4. Memphis Grizzlies(Round 2) - Lost in 6 to the Warriors.
5. Phoenix Suns(Round 2) - Lost in 7 to the Mavs. Objectively a hard fought series even if game 7 didn't feel like one. 
6. Denver Nuggets(Round 1) - Lost badly to the Warriors in 5. 
7. Minnesota Timberwolves(Round 1)  - Lost to the Grizzlies in 6. 
8. Charlotte Hornets(Play-In) - Got murdered in the play-in. 

Results: 3x Round 2, 4x Round 1, 1x Play-In. At least 3/8 lost in embarrassing fashion. No one made the Conference Finals. 

**Defense:**

1. Boston Celtics(Finals) - Lost in 6 to the Warriors. 
2. Golden State Warriors(Champions) - Beat the Celtics in 6. 
3. Phoenix Suns(Round 2) - Read above. 
4. Miami Heat(Conf Finals) - Lost in 7 to the Celtics while battling injuries. 
5. Cleveland Cavaliers(Play-In) - Lost to Brooklyn while missing Jarrett Allen who was integral to their defense in the first place. 
6. Memphis Grizzlies(Round 2) - Read above. 
7. Dallas Mavericks(Conf Finals) - Tough loss in 5 to the Warriors. 
8. LA Clippers(Play-In) - Lost to the Pelicans by 4. 

Results: 2x Finals, 2x Conf Finals, 2x Round 2, 2x Play-in. No embarrassing runs. Every team to make the Conference Finals is in this group, and therefore obviously both teams who made the Finals were as well. 

The only teams to make even the second round and not be in this group are the Sixers(12th on D) and the Bucks(14th on D) who, to be fair, both may have had a Conference Finals run in them if healthy. That being said, both teams also possess guys who have DPOY level impact when they want to in Embiid and Giannis so they're a bit unique. The Bucks defense was also greatly improved in the playoffs with the return of Lopez at the 5 as they posted the best DRtg of any playoff team.

nba,,Kareem Abdul Jabbar: “I am still the all-time leading scorer in the NBA and I only made one three-point shot.”
nba,"Whether you like it or not, the NBA at this point revolves around this narrative. We know LeBron is at number one or two. Most believe he is two and, barring a three-peat in his twilight years, will remain there until the next challenger to Jordan’s throne comes along. That leaves the rest of the active players to be decided—and as we all know, ranking the greats can get quite confusing, subjective, and outright testy. 

I will go out on a limb and state that the next best active players are Giannis, KD, and Steph. These are the guys who have won championships, MVPs, and clearly dominate the game regardless of regardless of whom they play, when they play, or what the prevailing weather patterns may be. 

Giannis’s narrative is still unfolding. But KD and Curry are nearing their twilight years, stretching their primes to their respective limits. Both are still putting up insane numbers and insane performances—KD in his heroic losing effort last year against the Bucks and Steph just days ago in Game 4 of the Finals. Both are breaking records and setting the standard for greatness. 

And yet, when discussing who’s better at this point in time, it gets pretty confusing, pretty quickly. On the one hand you’ve got the guy that most people would say is all around better. On the other, you’ve got the guy who’s now solidified himself in the conversation for top ten all time—and yet, the guy who most people say is better isn’t in the top ten. On its face, this would seem like an oxymoron. 

On the contrary, it’s a paradox. 

Where people go wrong in this conversation is positioning the question in a vacuum. Who’s the better basketball player? Well, no shit, it’s KD. The dude has the wingspan of a 737, the handles of an average two, the range of a guided missile, and pretty damn good defense for such a skinny big. One on one, it’s almost impossible to see Steph winning unless he doesn’t miss and KD clunks a bunny after backing him down in the paint. Kevin Durant is probably the best player in the game right now—and one of the best the game has ever seen. 

But basketball is a team sport. It’s not one on one. The National Basketball Association permits five guys to take the floor for a single team. The four guys playing with KD and Curry have to compliment them, understand the strategy, carry themselves with composure and confidence, and all work toward one single mission: win basketball games. 

Winning basketball games requires so much more than talent. It requires, above all, a winning mentality. If you’ve played sports, you know that competing is 95% psychological. And it’s more than the empty calm that Steph exhibits. His willingness to do literally everything it takes to win games is put on display by the way he plays, the way his coaches talk about him, and, of course, his track record. 

A defining moment for KD came during the 2018 WCF. Steve Kerr pulled KD aside and told him a parable about how Michael Jordan learned that he needed his teammates to win—because, once again, in crunch time, he was resorting to iso ball, which may have almost worked in the 2021 ECSFs, but failed him in 2016 and was failing him once again. 

This moment speaks volumes. Winning requires sticking to the formula that got you there. Winning requires sacrifice. Take away those years with the Warriors, and I really don’t know if KD wins one. He wasn’t the dude getting trapped at half court in every playoff game. He wasn’t the dude getting face guarded whenever his team had possession. He wasn’t the dude who was more than happy to hear critics talk about who won Finals MVP despite the aforementioned facts about defensive attention. 

I have watched both of these players since they entered the league. I have loved both of them. I was a die hard OKC fan when they played the Heat in 2012 and a die hard Dubs fan when they played the Cavs in 2015. Then I watched in a more neutral position after KD joined the Dubs until he left. If you watch the game of basketball and understand the game of basketball, you know it’s about winning, and the number of things that Steph does to win games is unparalleled. While KD has developed into a monster throughout his career, he still hasn’t managed to understand how to win, and he absolutely needed the Warriors far more than they needed him. (And now we know that Draymond did not in fact ‘call him crying in the parking lot’ 😂.) 

This needs to be understood because it’s about more than basketball—it’s about life. I finally realized that the reason people love Steph is because he defines success. It’s the same reason people loved MJ, why we wanted to love Lebron, and why we loved Kobe even when it was clear that LeBron had surpassed him. Stephen Curry is literally what success looks like, thinks like, and acts like. Sure, he’s got the talent, but it’s the mentality and the approach that makes him special. He’s not worried about the last miss, or the next game, or who won Finals MVP—that is, until he heard that it was the reason he wasn’t as good as Durant. He likes winning too much to put any of that stuff above This Moment. Kobe pointed out this fact when asked about Steph, because it takes one to know one. 

Stephen Curry will go down as not only one of the greatest basketball players to play the game, but also one of the greatest competitors. I truly admire this dude, and his greatness needs to be recognized beyond the unimportant debate of who’s ‘better’. When it comes to the professional version of the game of basketball as we know it, Steph Curry is hands down above Kevin Durant, and because greatness is a mindset, it will be difficult to surpass him.",Paradox Explained: How KD CAN Be ‘Better’ Than Steph But Ranked Lower All-Time

Notes: 

1. I know I don't have a consistent logic when it comes to these rankings. I believe each player and their careers need to be examined individually and in context. Applying a universal logic to the rankings belittles each player's careers and individual stories. 

2. I believe peak Lebron was better at basketball than peak MJ but MJ gets the advantage because of his achievements. I also believe Lebron played during a time when league competition was greater and suffered from worse circumstances. (Jordan would have accomplished equal or less than Lebron had he played in the same era with the same teams). Regardless, Jordan’s combination of an extraordinary high level of play and laundry list of accomplishments is too much for LeBron to overcome for the GOAT title. LeBron would need at least one more title for me to consider moving him up. Throw in another MVP and that might just do it. Worth noting however, that I would still take peak LeBron over peak Jordan if I was creating a fantasy team. 

3. Not all rings are created equal. Dirk's 2011 ring&gt;Durants 2 rings. Lebron's 2016 is treated the same way.

4. Bill Russell's achievements, despite a weak era, are too overwhelming to leave him out of the T5. Even if you applied a 30-40% discount to his accomplishments as an era-adjustment, they’re still spectacular. 

5. Bird&gt;Magic because he had a greater peak, worse supporting cast, and he would have been even better (maybe another title and MVP) had he not gotten hurt in the late 80’s. Only Jordan (and Russell) matched Bird’s dominance over the league over a 6 year span. I don’t feel too strongly about this and could easily check out some Magic film or stats swap the two. I’ve always been a Bird guy so maybe there’s some bias there too. 

6. Dirk&gt;KG bc Dirk's ring holds more value than KG's. Dirk also has more impressive stats and longevity. KG had a greater two-way peak but it was short-lived compared to Dirk’s extended prime. His Finals run in 2006 and Championship in 2011 are both more impressive than anything KG did. 

7. Isiah gets underrated by many. The only ""little guy"" outside of Curry to be the best player on a title team (multiple title teams actually). Also, he did this in a super competitive era (Bird Celts and Magic/Kareem Lakers).

8. Some might notice the exclusion of Oscar Robertson from this list. I think he might be the most overrated T25 player ever. I’ve seen people with him in their T10. He’s less accomplished than everyone else on this list and played in a weaker era. Not to mention that he didn’t win his sole title until Kareem arriver and basically carried him there. His box score stats aren’t nearly as impressive after adjusting for era and considering that Westbrook essentially matched it. I don’t understand how anyone can say with a straight face that he’s ahead of Hakeem, Curry, Durant, Moses, Erving, etc.

9. Giannis might already be more accomplished than Dirk and KG and also had a greater peak (especially playoff peak). Obviously he hasn’t played long enough to match the totality of their careers in terms of career stats and all star appearances etc. but I expect him to get that easily. I expect him to be in the top 5 by the end of his career. Worst case scenario is probably still top 10. I could also argue his 2-3 year peak (assuming his true peak isn’t yet to come) is the 3rd best ever behind LeBron and MJ. 

10. The biggest change is the upward movement of Stephen Curry. I’ve thought for some time that peak Curry has a case for the most valuable/best offensive player ever. At worst, he’s 3rd on that list. His impact on the sport speaks for itself. My two concerns with his placement are the extent to which Durant was responsible for 2 of his 4 rings and his relative lack of regular season accolades. Particularly in the career volume sense. Luka Doncic has only 1 less First Team All-NBA than Curry! He has also only finished top 2 in MVP voting twice. For comparison, Larry Bird did the same 8 times. Others ahead of him have similarly strong performance in that regard. He likely won’t get to 30k pts or 10k assists either. His only real claim to fame in the regular season would be the all-time 3pt record. His age, quantity of other MVP level superstars in the league, and the degree of parity make it unlikely that he’ll accomplish too much more and thus makes it unlikely that he move up the list. There’s a pretty substantial gap between 7. Tim Duncan and 8. Curry in my opinion.

nba,"THE LEBRON JAMES TIME TRAVEL HYPOTHESIS

*no no no no no. It doesn't make sense. Make it make sense.* 

These were the last words I heard in my dream as I laid wide awake on my california king sized bed in my lebron james bed covers and in my lebron james jammies. My father left me for my mother. 

I've been trying to find an answer to LeBron's 2011 loss to the Mavericks for 5 straight years now. For those 5 straight years, I have pulled all-nighters. It just doesn't make sense to me that the Heat could've lost to the Mavericks. My brain can't fathom it. How can one even go to bed knowing that one of the greatest mysteries has yet to be solved?

My Hypothesis: **LeBron did not play college basketball, which ultimately led to his poor performance and loss in the 2011 finals against Daddy Dirk.**

Let's say that in 2011, LeBron takes the time machine back to 2003 to go to college. He plays NCAA basketball and gains a lot of experience on the court, and that's excluding the fact that he had experience while playing in high school. He decides to go back to the future. But as soon as he goes back to the past, does he not alter the timeline so that the 2011 he returns to is a different 2011 and not the 2011 in which the Heat even made the Finals, and the Mavericks won the chip? Or could LeBron come back to the same 2011 because it wasn't until 2010 that he placed the decision to take his talents to South Beach? Actually this raises another question. Is ""placed"" the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future? I think not! I think ""had will have placed"" would be the proper tense. Anyways, so could LeBron come back to the same 2011 because it wasn't until 2010 that he had will have placed the decision to go back to Miami?

Wait, but if LeBron goes back to 2003, then the alternate future he creates isn't the one in which LeBron uses the time machine to travel back to 2011. So then in the new future, LeBron never had have had (correct tense used) brought the time machine. So doesn't that mean that the 2011 LeBron could also not had have had brought the time machine back to 2003. So isn't the 2003 timeline in which LeBron goes to college also the timeline in which LeBron never had have has the opportunity to go to college?",The LeBron James Time Travel Hypothesis (TLJTTH).

I collected the most interesting answers and I will try to react on each of them

**1. Yes the game will continue to evolve.**

**What is this? Pokemon?** is usually the response for anti evolutionist. But personally, I think average players today are really more skilled and athletic than average players in the past(Average/Role Players, Not outliers like Wilt, Kareem, MJ)

But, I admit it is mostly due to better scientific training and medicine. 


**2. I think the more we learn and the more resources that young players have at their instant disposal, the more skilled players will be. Not just in basketball but any sport really.**

This is exactly my point in my answer in question number 1. 

**3. Yes. Evolution /advancements never stop. We will see a 50% 3 point shooter too.**

Steve Kerr did this already in the 90s. Joe Harris did this recently. But I think he is talking about consistent volume 50% 3pt shooter. Like steph is like 42-43% in threes. I doubt we will have a steph like shooter who will have a 50% accuracy. But we never know.🤷

**4.Yes you gonna see a shooter who is ambidextrous, and gonna use that as a main weapon, the game always evolves.**

This is very doable. There are some ambidextrous nba players in the history of nba. For ex: Bird in old era, and Lebron in new era. Though, they did not do it consistently, they showed they are capable of doing it. I bet a future player who will shoot Jumpers ambidextrously. 

**5. At some point, there would be a 7 footer athletic freak that can do it all. He probably wont become the GOAT though because he will be going up against other freaks that are almost as good.**

Lmao. Some are saying this is KD or Embiid or Jokic. But I think it is possible we can have a 7 footer with even more complete skillsets in the future. 

**7. Steph’s 3 point will be broken easily.  More players are given the green light.  Also younger players are practicing it so the whole team will be even more spread out which means more open looks.**

Hot take. Broken easily? I dont think it will be broken in at least 20-30 yrs. I agree though, that steph's impact

**8. I just can’t wait to hear about how the non star players of today will be regarded as “milkmen” in 20 years by a bunch of 10 year olds whose parents are current r/nba nephews.**

Haha. I always say this too in the topic of evolution. Since some New heads today are saying 50s-60s players are farmers, plumbers, and bums. Will they also accept if in 2050-2060 Future Heads will say 2010s-2020s are less skilled too? I reckon not, especially Lebron and Steph Fans. Lmao. 

But as I always said the consensus top 25 players of all time imo are all transcendent, meaning they can play in any era including near future era. 

Will Lebron/Steph be viewed as how we viewed Wilt/Russell Today? Hmmm. Interesting.

nba,"Since Curry's unbelievable finals performance the overall take of Curry&gt;KD 'and it isn't even close' has been more prevalent than ever.


If someone said to me that Curry's been better than KD since 2015 I would probably disagree.
At first, then I'd think well Curry won back to back MVP's in 2015 and 2016. 

Finished 1 win away from 2 rings in a row and blew his own previous record (and all time nba record of 286) for total made 3s in a season out of the water (with 402).


After this season KD would arrive and win back to back FMVPs. While the 2018 FMVP is still somewhat debated to this day, with KD averaging:


28.8/10.8/7.5 on 65.4% TS


While steph averaged:

27.5/6.0/6.8 on 56.0% TS


A large percentage of this win has been credited to Steph and his ability to stretch the floor, opening easy shots and drives to the basket for his teammates. Often to referred to in a half-joking way as his 'gravity' this FMVP can somewhat go either way.


The 2017 finals is a little different though. I can't see how Curry is the Most Valuable Player in this particular series, a statline of:

KD - 35.2/8.2/5.4 on 69.8% TS


Curry - 26.8/8.0/9.4 on 61.95% TS


KD was clearly the More Valuable Player in this series. Throughout these 2 regular seasons and the 2 playoff runs they averaged very similar numbers (the only real difference coming in KD's numbers being better than Curry's in the 2018 playoffs despite Curry having the better TS% in the regular season).


The 2019 playoffs until the 20/21 season starts are hard to rank due to the injuries. But since the 20/21 season has started Curry has clearly been more Valuable despite Durant having an all time great series against the Bucks in the 2021 playoffs.



If you want to tell me Curry has been better than KD since 2015, fine. It isn't a hill I will die on. But I doubt you're willing to die on the hill that Curry has been as clear of KD as was the other way round for over half a decade.



KD was drafted to Seattle in the 07/08 season, where he would average 20 ppg and win the rookie of the year award, in his next season the team would move to Oklahoma and KD would score 25 ppg, in his third season (09/10) KD would put his name in the books by averaging 30.1 ppg on 60.7% TS which won him his first scoring title at the age of 21.



Curry may have one of the most inspirational stories of any nba superstar, the undersized PG 'who should be playing SG' with the bad ankles has transformed into maybe the most dangerous offensive weapon of all time and certainly one of the leagues most transformative players.


However, we have to judge players on the numbers they actually accumulated... Perhaps even the most devoted Steph fan would admit he became the era-defining player he is in the 13-14 season at the absolute earliest, I'd imagine most would say the 2015 mvp season was when he became one of the best in the league and in 2016 he became truly historic, however... In the 2013/14 season Kevin Durant collected his 4th scoring title (5th player to ever have that many) and an MVP.

nba,"I have known this since 2016 and have been waiting for the right moment to make people realize this. It would have been known all along had they not played together. But now it is 100% undeniable. 

The Superficials:

Steph is a better offensive player at any level—shooting, passing, ball handling, etc. The only thing KD has on Steph is defense, and it’s not like Steph is a slouch. Steph is even a great rebounding guard. 

The X’s and O’s:

In every single series of every single playoffs they played together, Steph was double teamed from the moment he crossed half court. If you understand basketball, you understand that you don’t double team the second best player and then face guard him in the corner. The best way for the Warriors to win in this dynamic is to allow KD to go four on three. Needless to say, Steph made KD’s job easy for him. In a vacuum, Steph freely gives up the ball when double teamed while KD will go iso from the parking lot. 

The Truth:

Most importantly, the NBA is five on five. If it were one on one, KD would be better. But it’s not. It’s five on five. Team sports require from their leaders exactly the intangibles that Steph has. This is why KD has failed thus far to lead a team. He is an ego driven anxiety case. 

Steph allowed KD to take the spotlight without saying a single word to the media to defend his own abilities—which at once made us love him and unbelievably frustrated for not pointing to his greatness. He doesn’t care what the media or people think, as long as they’re winning. He knew he was the best player on the team and had the confidence to avoid lashing out at those knocking him for Finals MVPs that KD won because of Steph’s existence. 

Steph just proved this point—yet again—by winning without the so-called ‘better player’. Durant had all the talent in the world on OKC and now Brooklyn. Steph beat him in OKC. Steph beat the team in the finals that SWEPT Brooklyn in the first round. 

The W:

Most importantly, Steph is a winner. He is up there with the the all time greats because his name is equated with winning, while KD’s equated with burner accounts. He is the most humble, calm, stone-faced assassin in the game since Kobe Bryant. He has the ability to block out the past and future in a way that very few athletes can. It is the single most important gift in sports. He doesn’t care who scores, how they score, or how they win, as long as they win. He’s not on Twitter proving he’s a nervous wreck inside. The dude literally does not care as long as his team has more points than the other team when the buzzer goes off. 

This idea that KD was the better player is dead. Better players win more. Steph won with less talent than a lot of teams out there this year. This one puts it to bed.",It’s Official: Steph is Better Than KD at Five On Five NBA Basketball

nba,,Someone brought a goat to the Warriors parade. What would you bring to your team’s championship parade?
nba,"Contrary to popular belief, KD was not better than Steph on the Warriors.

Let's take a look at a couple of interesting facts:

1) RAPTOR

Curry:

16-17: 9.3 OFF / -0.1 DEF / Total RAPTOR 9.2 / 20.7 WAR
17-18: 8.1 OFF / -0.5 DEF / Total RAPTOR 7.6 / 11.8 WAR
18-19: 7.5 OFF / 0.3 DEF / Total RAPTOR 7.8 / 17.6 WAR

Durant 16-17: 5.9 OFF / 1.1 DEF / Total RAPTOR 7.1 / 13.3 WAR
17-18: 5.9.OFF / -0.7 DEF / Total RAPTOR 5.2 / 13.0.WAR
18-19: 5.2 OFF / -0.2 DEF / Total RAPTOR 5.1 / 12.8 WAR

So, as we can see here Steph outdid KD in total RAPTOR all 3 years and in WAR 2 out of 3 years. Notably, Steph's WAR was quite significantly larger in those 2 years and the year KD outdid Steph in WAR, he barely squeaked by Steph. 

2) Win/Loss Records

Steph w/ KD 131-37 (.780)
Steph w/o KD 27-4 (.871)
KD w/o Steph 23-17 (.575)

Anyone who has watched the Warriors knows that their system revolves around Steph and did so even when KD was there. The Warriors got into trouble when KD went ISO crazy. And KD's ISO heavy style is, arguably, one of the reasons why he still hasn't won anything since leaving Steph.

nba,"For the second part of this, I wanted to go into what these players would look like physically. For the perfect NBA team, the players would largely have very similar physiques with some variations specific to each position. Everyone would have large hands, long arms, be relatively muscular, athletic, and low body fat (professional basketball players are typically 6-12% body fat and very lean players like Dennis Rodman get as low as 5% which isn’t surprising given his crazy endurance). I’ll be giving general descriptions as well as specific measurements based on my best estimates.

Guards:

Think Anthony Edwards, Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell or any other undersized, athletic shooting guard. More stocky than big, on the shorter side for a shooting guard (remember these players would play both shooting guard and point guard) but with decent weight and strength for absorbing contact while driving to the basket.

height: 6’4”

weight: 220 lbs

wingspan: 7’1”

body fat: 5-8%

handspan: 11.25 inches

Wings:

These players would be similar to the forwards, but smaller and quicker, while still having incredible strength and power, but not to the same degree. hypothetically, with players like LeBron you could probably go up to 260 while still having an incredibly quick player but a 220 player would likely be quicker while still being more than strong enough to dominate even a lot of big men. Dennis Rodman didn’t have much of an issue at this weight, even going up against guys like Karl Malone and Shaq. I’d essentially want something that blends LeBron’s size and strength and Jordan’s agility and quickness.

height: 6’7”

weight: 220 lbs

wingspan: 7’5”

body fat: 5-8%

handspan: 11.75 inches

Forwards:

They’d be versatile and athletic, not so heavy to lose speed or endurance, but still quite large and strong. overall, very similar to LeBron James with Kevin Durant’s/Giannis’/Kevin Garnett’s height and length. LeBron has the size and strength to take on centers and the quickness to take on guards and perimeter players. Giannis, KG, and KD are all 7 footers with guard-like agility and incredible length. The perfect forward would combine aspects of these players physically. LeBron was 245 and 7% body fat entering the league and around 260-275 in Miami. Giannis, KG, and KD are all 6’9”-7’0” while still being agile and quick. This combination of Giannis type height and LeBron type weight would look more like Dwight Howard, Hakeem Olajuwon or Anthony Davis than either Giannis or LeBron, but have both incredible size and agility.

height: 6’10”

weight: 260 lbs

wingspan: 7’8”

body fat: 5-10%

handspan: 12.25 inches

Bigs:

They’d be the biggest, strongest players on the team, most similar to Shaquille O’Neal and Wilt Chamberlain. They’d have Shaq’s power and agility, massive hands and weight, but more similar to his body when he was with Orlando Magic than when he was with the Lakers. They’d have Wilt Chamberlain’s strength, speed, jumping ability, height, and length. 300 lbs seems heavy for any player, but Shaq was 300 in Orlando and weighed 340-370 with the Lakers, and Wilt was heavier than his listed 275 for a lot of his career, often around 290.

7/35 = 20% (clear cut)
11/35 = 31% (debatably)

15’ and 16’ are both tough to decide, both classes are still young and have plenty of time before a clear choice comes out. For 15’ I’m leaning towards Booker because of the finals trip and leading his team to the best record this past season. 16’ Simmons is still the most accomplished IMO. He has the most All Star appearances, All Defensive team selections, and the ROY. Unfortunately he doesn’t care about ball so currently I would probably lean towards Brown as the best. 

‘02 Yao and Amare are very similar. They both dominated early on but suffered injury problems and by the 2010s Yao was done and Amare had fallen off quickly after. Toss up choice IMO.

‘00 was such a bad class I don’t even know who is the best lmao. Kinda just wanted to skip it.

Most of the 1OA’s end up having solid careers even if they weren’t the best in that class. Several of them had serious injury problems that held them back or cut their primes short. Only a few are legit busts like Anthony Bennett or Michael Olowkandi.

nba,"I have put a lot of thought into what the perfect NBA team would look like. I’ve come up with a format for a 12 (twelve) man roster where there is no definitive starting lineup but rather the most versatile set of 12 players where many lineups could be constructed depending on the situation and what is needed based on any opposing teams strengths and weaknesses. I’ll go into more detail in a second part but to start I will be outlining what is needed on this team.
that roster would look something like this:

Guards:
Two versatile guards who could operate similarly to the wings mentioned in the next paragraph, providing perimeter defense, scoring and playmaking, although these guards would be smaller and quicker than the wings, operating as Dwyane Wade type slashing combo guards.

Wings:
Five highly versatile wings who could play every position on the court, from a tall point guard like Magic Johnson/Anfernee Hardaway to an undersized big like Dennis Rodman/Charles Barkley/Wes Unseld. They would be very similar to Scottie Pippen, providing perimeter defense, playmaking and scoring, especially as slashers. On my starting lineup, they’d play the 1, 2 and 3, operating as perimeter defenders on defense and point forwards and slashers on offense.

Forwards:
Three highly versatile forwards who also have the size and post skills to play center. Essentially a blend of Giannis, LeBron, KD and KG, they’d be able to play the 3 through 5 positions, having everything from the size and post skills of a classic big man to guard skills like solid handles, outside shooting and playmaking. On my starting lineup, I’d have them at the 4 and 5, operating as rim protectors and rebounders on defense and point forwards, stretch bigs and slashers on offense.

Bigs:
Two versatile bigs who could dominate inside as post scorers and rim protectors, solid mid-range scoring and outside shooting. They’d be very similar to the forwards previously mentioned, but bigger and stronger, meaning they wouldn’t be as effective as slashers. They’d mostly be role players who spend a lot of time on the bench, but still adding Shaq/Hakeem level paint dominance.

You’ll notice a lot of emphasis is put on slashers, playmaking and defense. Obviously all of the players on my ideal team would also be great shooters, but I want to make it clear how important it is that they all be able to drive to the basket exceptionally well, whether it’s to kick out to a teammate or for a dunk or layup.",Creating the Perfect NBA Team Part 1: Positions

He never won back to back rings.


Choked against the 8th seed grizzlies 4-2 as a 1st seed.


Got bronze with team usa being in his prime and the best player on the team.


Tony Parker won the finals mvp over him in 2007, near his prime. In the last two games of the series he shot 6/17 (14 points) in a 3 point win and 4/15 (12 points) in a 1 point win. Also had 6 turnovers and shot 4/10 from the line in that 1 point win.


He choked when the Spurs went up 2-0 vs the Lakers in 2004. Averaged 17 PPG on 36% from the field in their 4 straight losses. 


Was a role player in his final ring when kawhi won the finals mvp.


Only averaged 25ppg + one time in his career.

* **Denver**: 1-3
* **Memphis**: 1-3

* **Overall**: 4-10

There's a pretty good reason for this anomaly: Golden State rarely had all 3 of their leaders (Steph, Klay, and Dray) on the court together in the regular-season, leading to underwhelming performances at times. Still, it does provide one of the biggest discrepancies in regular-season vs playoff performances against the teams an NBA champion has put up against their opponents.

nba,"I’ll start this by saying, undeniably, LeBron has had one of the greatest careers of all time. Regardless on where you place him vs Jordan, he is an all time great. However, we live in the age of social media, and social media is dominated by narrative. Due to his greatness and his controversy, dislike of LeBron is incredibly common on social media, and many people continue to hate on him, declaring his rings “fraudulent.” In 2020, during the bubble, LeBron’s Lakers defeated Jimmy Butler’s Heat to win the championship of the shortened season. As usual, haters came out of the woodwork to find a reason to discredit his success. This time, due to the bubble being held in Disney World, the ring was discredited as being a “Mickey Mouse Championship”, and eventually led to the nickname of “LeMickey.” Eventually, this narrative has become so popular than a sizable amount of fans on social media genuinely believe that the ring was illegitimate and is a stain against LeBron’s legacy. This leads me to the main question: how much damage has “LeMickey” done to LeBron’s legacy?",How much has the “LeMickey” nickname truly impacted LeBron’s legacy?

Olynyk would be able to stretch the floor for the Lakers, which would benefit both Lebron and Westbrook, if he's still a Laker.

Lyrics: 

Hey Kenny Atkinson  
What’s it like in San Francisco?  
Hope that new Dubs ring fits nicely  
Cause in Charlotte you’re a zero  
Yes you are  
You could have coached a rising star  
Been our new Czar

Hey Kenny Atkinson  
Don’t you worry about the Hornets  
We’ve been losers for 3 decades  
And we’ll probably never win shit  
But you still suck  
Hitched up to Steve Kerr we’ve been cucked  
Man what the fuck

Oh you bailed on Buzz City  
Oh you bailed on Buzz City  
Oh you bailed on Buzz City  
Oh you bailed on Buzz City  
Bailed on Buzz City

Hey Kenny Atkinson  
Yes we got smoked by the Hawks  
But just believe me, man  
Someday we’ll find our way to the playoffs  
We’ll have it good  
Get bounced in round 1 like we should  
My word is good

Hey Kenny Atkinson  
I’ve got so much left to say  
If every simple song I wrote to you  
Would make your feel ashamed  
I’d write it all  
To turn your back on MJ takes some gall  
I’m so appalled

Oh you bailed on Buzz City  
Oh you bailed on Buzz City  
Oh you bailed on Buzz City  
Oh you bailed on Buzz City

Alonzo’s shot in ’93  
When we had and LJ and Mugsy  
The future sure did seem bright on that day  
Then got moved to New Orleans  
Fuck you forever Mr. Shinn  
Then got the Bobcats who won 7 games  
Kenny I can promise you  
That when the Hornets do break through  
Your life will never ever be the same  
And you’re to blame

Hey Kenny Atkinson  
You be good and don’t you miss us  
A few more years and we’ll be rising  
And you’ll still be Kerr’s minion like a fool  
You know it’s because you’re a tool  
We can hire whoever we want to  
Hey there Kenny here’s to you  
This one’s for you

Oh you bailed on Buzz City  
Oh you bailed on Buzz City  
Oh you bailed on Buzz City

Do y'all think SGA is at Ja's level? IMO he definitely is and i don't think Ja can do a lot of things Shai couldn't and I'M NOT SAYING SGA BETTER RN.

If we talking skillwise shai is a better shooter and a slightly better playmaker as well, both of them are not the best on ball defenders, Ja's a better finisher but not really by much and i think Shai's handles are better, they both very fast and really quick, they both young players so i wouldn't say one has a higher ball IQ than the other. 

Another very important aspect and the reason why i think Ja may always have an edge in this debate is that he is A LOT more athletic than Shai and that's what makes Ja so good and an all-nba caliber player (but far from the only reason or even the most important one). 

On top of this Ja plays in a better team with better coaching and floor spacing so he has more support but you could say that SGA team is the reason why he stands out so much (wich i totally disagree but its a valid point i guess).

So, if i didn't forget anything, that is my argument on why i think SGA is or is very close to be at that level. Yes, ALL NBA/ALL STAR level

My question is that Russell's 11 rings is very very impressive, but I feel like because there are only 8 teams in the league at the time, it is like being guaranteed a play-off spot every time and just having to win a conference.

nba,"Just saw a post on here about Dame and it got me thinking about Portland who I think will overachieve next year given how bad they were this year. I think they’re being overlooked since they actually have some good pieces and if Dame comes back right from his injury he could even win MVP if he has a 30+ and 8 type of year which he basically had the last two years before injury. 

What moves should they make to compete in a difficult west? I think a guy like Josh Hart might be good to keep as he’s a 3&amp;D and rebounding wing. I assume Nurkic gets traded too. Not sure what they’ll do about Anfernee Simons because he looks like he could be an elite point guard down the line but not sure how Dame and him would work together both being small guards, bc Simons is too good to be getting 20 backup point guard minutes a game. They also have the 7th pick if they don’t want to use it on an immediate impact guy.  Have seen some people say they’ll trade for OG or sign &amp; trade for Ayton but their front office has been weak as of recent so not sure if they’ll get either. Their team situation seems weird at the moment for a team that claims they want to win now, but the window to win with Dame is closing and they obviously need to improve the roster as of now. 

Not even a Portland fan but I love watching Dame play and hope they can at least put a competent team around him as he’s 31 rn and running out of time.",What will Portland do in the offseason?

nba,"Despite missing half the playoffs, it's hard to deny Gary Payton II's impact to Golden State's title run.

His shooting stats: 29-44 FG (65%), 8-15 from 3 (53%), 12-18 from FT (67%)

He had five performances where he made 3 or more shots, all Golden State victories

* Game 3 at Denver: 4-4 FG, 3-3 from three, 11 points
* Game 5 vs. Denver: 6-8 FG, 3-4 from three, 15 points (including a clutch 3 and layup late)
* Game 1 at Memphis: 4-5 FG, 8 points (including a game-tying layup in crunchtime)
* Game 2 vs. Boston: 3-3 FG, 1-1 from three, 7 points
* Game 5 vs. Boston: 6-8 FG, 1-3 from three, 15 points

What's most impressive is the defensive impact though, particularly in his final six games--of the Warriors seven most successful lineups in the 2022 NBA Finals (that played more than 5 minutes), five featured Gary Payton II, three were outstanding defensively, and Golden State's net rating was 10+ for all five.

&amp;#x200B;

|Lineup|Minutes|Offensive rating|Defensive rating|Net rating|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Thompson-Green-Wiggins-Looney-Poole|6|109.1|50|59.1|

|**Curry-Green-Porter-Wiggins-Payton II**|12|128|118.2|9.8|

Interestingly, Golden State's best lineup of the playoffs that played 10+ minutes didn't get as much run in the Finals (probably because Wiggins was playing too well), but it also featured Payton II.

* The smallest range of scores during a series was 5 (2009 lakers), while the largest was 50 (2008 Celtics)
* In their finals appearances in 1977 and 1980 76ers never scored more than 110 points and only scored less than 100 points once (they did score 107 points 6 times in 12 finals games)

&gt; In an interview with The Athletic, Beal said he has made up his mind about his playing future but declined to disclose his decision, saying it would be improper to discuss any potential future contract while he’s still fulfilling his current contract.

&gt; But Beal said previously that he was leaning toward remaining with the Wizards, and he’s giving no indications that his mind has changed. Team officials have said they want to retain Beal for the long term, and in a show of support, Wizards president and general manager Tommy Sheppard and Wizards head coach Wes Unseld Jr. attended Saturday’s court dedication event.

&gt; Beal is expected to decline his $36.4 million player option for the 2022-23 season and become an unrestricted free agent when the NBA’s free-agency period starts in nearly two weeks. Because the Wizards hold Beal’s Bird rights, the Wizards are the only team that can offer him a five-year contract. That contract could be worth up to a maximum total of nearly $248 million.

&gt; Under league rules, the longest and most expensive contract Beal could sign with any other team would be a four-year deal worth a maximum total of roughly $184 million, even if it’s a sign-and-trade transaction. The Wizards would not be allowed to complete a sign-and-trade involving Beal without Beal’s consent.

&gt; Beal, who will turn 29 late this month, has said he wants to win with the Wizards.

&gt; It’s no wonder, then, that it’s widely assumed Beal will remain with Washington.

&gt; But apparently players from other teams aren’t giving up hope. When Beal was asked by The Athletic how many players are trying to recruit him and asking him to join their teams, he answered, “A lot. A lot. You know I can’t give you names.”

&gt; Beal disclosed he returned Friday to on-court basketball work for the first time since he underwent season-ending wrist surgery Feb. 10, and he said he no longer faces any limitations on his wrist.","[Robbins] In an interview with The Athletic, [Bradley] Beal said he has made up his mind about his playing future but declined to disclose his decision. When asked how many players are trying to recruit him &amp; asking him to join their teams, he answered “A lot. A lot. You know I can’t give you names”"

nba,"The Warriors set a record this year for luxury tax payments, and figure to have a higher payroll next year.  The 22 teams that didn’t pay luxury tax during the ‘21-22 season all received a payout of approximately $12 million each…and that figure might grow next year because of the largesse of the Warriors, Clippers and (possibly) the Nets, Lakers and Mavs.  

These high payrolls are not only a competitive advantage for the high-payroll team - think of the Warriors’ depth this year if they just had a ‘normal’ luxury tax payroll and no Wiggins - but they are also a deterrent for other franchises from even dipping into the luxury tax, because not only do they pay extra for the players they sign, they miss out on the $12M+ windfall at the end of the season from the combined luxury tax bill created by the Warriors, Clippers, Nets (assuming Kyrie is back), and Dallas (assuming Brunson is back).  

We are already seeing the Nuggets make a tax-avoidant trade, and we will likely see the Suns sign-and-trade Ayton and go cheap at center to duck the tax. 

Prediction:  less teams than usual will use their taxpayer MLE in hopes of trying to get that windfall, and at least one team will pull an OKC and start the season 20% below the salary floor in anticipation of swallowing someone else’s bad salary at the deadline.  

The point of this post is simply that at some point, crazy unprecedented spending by a few teams both this year and during the next year is actually a deterrent to other teams spending due to the way luxury tax payouts are spread out to the non-luxury tax paying teams.  

That should be impacting teams’ internal predictions of what their own FAs will garner on the market.  There might be only 1-4 teams that actually use their taxpayer MLE, because very few teams will want to be taxpayers.  

The top guys will get paid like they always do, but I think the $5M-10M player is going to get squeezed and several guys who projected to get that type of money will instead settle for minimums in desirable locales.","The more money that the Warriors, Nets and Clippers spend this summer, the less incentive every other team has to break the bank"

nba,"One of the narratives as the NBA season goes on — and especially as the playoffs start — is that teams that feature strong ball movement will be more effective than those that feature a one-dimensional or heliocentric offense. Using passing, assists, and possession data from nba.com, I’ve created a metric that measures the teams with the best motion offenses, movement offense efficiency — MOE.

First let’s talk about what a movement offense *is*. In simple terms, a movement offense uses multiple passes (ball movement) to create a highly efficient scoring opportunity. Examples of non-ball movement offenses would be a five out strategy of ball penetration and kicking out for a highly efficient 3 point shot, a pick and roll offense, or an offense that uses screens and hand-offs to create switches that provide favorable match-ups. *A movement offense requires multiple passes that lead to a high quality shot.*

There are two components to this: Teams that pass a lot and teams with a lot of assists. A team can pass a lot but not have a lot of assists. This would be an offense that uses passing to create favorable isolations (or just a bad offense!). A team can have a lot of assists, but not a lot of passes. This would be an offense that uses driving or switches to create favorable shots off of passes. So what we really need to do is combine two team metrics: Passes and Assists.

What is MOE?

This is the essence of MOE: Combining team passes per possession and team assists per possession. The trouble is that while each can be measured objectively, combining the two requires some kind of relative baseline, as passes per possession are much higher than assists per possession.

MOE thus relies on indexing. We take passes per possession and divide by the league average. An average team will index at 100. Teams that pass more than the league average index higher, and those that pass less index lower. Once we do the same for assists, we can then average the two and there you go:

MOE = Team passes per possession index + Team assists per possession index / 2

As a result you end up with the following:

Teams that pass more than the league average but assist less have a low MOE.

Teams that assist more than the league average but pass less have a low MOE.

Teams that pass greater than the league average and those passes convert to assists greater than the league average have a high MOE.

Teams that pass a lot

The following five teams led the league in the 2021–2022 season in passing per possession:

Denver Nuggets (109.7)  
Indiana Pacers (108.2)  
Golden State Warriors (108.2)  
Philadelphia 76ers (107.7)  
Cleveland Cavaliers (106.9)

Denver is an interesting case. They are pretty significantly ahead of the league in terms of passing, yet a lot of people wouldn’t think of Denver as a pass-centric team. However, when you think of the passes they make into Jokic and then his passes back out, that leads to an in-out motion offense, just not one that we traditionally think of in terms of passes around the perimeter to people moving off ball.

Teams that assist a lot

The following five teams led the league in the 2021–2022 season in assists per possession:

Denver Nuggets (113.6)  
San Antonio Spurs (111.8)  
Charlotte Hornets (110.6)  
Golden State Warriors (109.7)  
Phoenix Suns (109.1)

Denver is again at top. Surprised? The team that passes it the most per possession in the league is also the team that has the most assists per possession. Denver’s offense is unique in that they have Nikola Jokic. Jokic allows Denver to have a highly effective — yet very different — kind of motion offense, one where passes effectively move around the perimeter by going in-out rather than around the outside.

MOE leaders

Below are top five teams in the league at utilizing an efficient motion offense as defined by MOE.

Denver Nuggets (111.62)  
Golden State Warriors (108.97)  
Charlotte Hornets (106.60)  
Miami Heat (106.04)  
Cleveland Cavaliers (105.92)

And there we have it: The five teams that have the most effective motion offenses in the league. One of the single biggest takeaways here is that this is not a measure of teams that just pass the ball, but teams that are effective while doing so. Look at Charlotte. This is a slightly above average team in terms of passing quantity, but they are no. 3 at those passes leading to score.

Take a look at the Philadelphia 76ers in the **Teams that pass a lot** section. This is a team that passes nearly as often per per possession as Golden State, yet they are below league average for those passes leading to assists. Philadelphia passes a lot. They just aren’t that good at it. This may be due to Joel Embiid being the center of the 76ers offense, yet Embiid not being nearly as good as Jokic at finding the perimeter player with the good look.

Motion? More like isolation.

So who are the worst teams in the league at moving the ball? Below are the bottom five teams in the league at utilizing an efficient motion offense.

Milwaukee Bucks (92.20)  
Utah Jazz (93.96)  
New York Knicks (94.67)  
Houston Rockets (94.97)  
Sacramento Kings (95.14)

Teams like the New York Knicks aren’t necessarily an iso team. They pass the ball an average amount but just aren’t very good with the ball when they do.

Iso-focused Teams

I’ll be writing an article about heliocentric players soon, but let’s take a look at *teams* that are heliocentric and yet generate a lot of assists. These would be non-motion teams that are effective at running things like pick and rolls and penetration and kick outs for threes.

Note that these teams can have extremely potent offenses, just in a non-motion way. I took the pass per possession rank and simply subtracted the assist per possession rank. They higher the number here illustrates a truly iso-focused team.

Phoenix Suns (24)  
Brooklyn Nets (17)  
Memphis Grizzlies (15)  
Atlanta Hawks (13)  
San Antonio Spurs (13)

How important is a motion offense?

So now that we can identify the top motion offenses in terms of their efficiency at generating assists with those passes, how good are they at actually generating *offense*? Here are the top five MOE teams and their offensive efficiency rank (MOE rank, team, O efficiency rank):

1. Denver Nuggets (6)
2. Golden State Warriors (15)
3. Charlotte Hornets (9)
4. Miami Heat (11)
5. Cleveland Cavaliers (20)

The answer is pretty obvious: A motion-centric offense doesn’t correlate at all to an overall efficient *scoring* offense. In fact, a good *motion* efficiency actually correlates to mediocre *offense* efficiency. Why? What is the difference between the two?

Well, it’s important to note that offensive efficiency looks at scoring for each possession. MOE looks at assists generated in each possession. Teams that score a lot without a lot of assists can have highly efficient offenses. In fact, let’s do the same exercise as we did above for our top ISO-focused teams (Iso rank, team, O efficiency rank):

1. Phoenix Suns (5)
2. Brooklyn Nets (10)
3. Memphis Grizzlies (3)
4. San Antonio Spurs (18)
5. Atlanta Hawks (2)

And there you have it: Three of the top five and four of the top ten offensive teams in the league are iso-centric.

Does this mean that a motion offense is a poor choice in today’s NBA? Well, a lot of the choice of which offense works depends on scheme and personnel, but there is also another factor — the playoffs.

MOE in the playoffs

One of the common beliefs is that heliocentric offenses are easier to scheme against in the playoff and as a result, motion offenses are built more for success in the post-season. Let’s look at MOE teams in the playoffs.

Immediately we see something obvious: 2 of the top 5 MOE teams from the regular season were in the conference finals and the number 2 team won the title. That’s some pretty strong anecdotal evidence, but let’s look at the playoffs as a whole and see if MOE correlates to playoff wins.

First, let’s look at the averages to see if things have changed overall. The average number of passes per possession in the playoffs was 2.80. During the season it was 2.86. It could be that there were more iso-focused teams in the playoffs, but the averages don’t lie: Teams pass *less* in the playoffs. How about assists? There were 0.232 assists per possession in the playoffs and 0.247 during the regular season. So assists are down, too.

Note that these are per possession numbers, so pace doesn’t matter. The overall picture is pretty clear: As a whole, the playoffs are much more isolation-heavy than the regular season.

Note that this could be due to more iso-teams making the playoffs. How do things look for our two top motion teams that made the conference finals? Golden State’s passes per possession went from 3.09 to 2.83 and Miami’s went from 3.04 to 2.92. So even our motion offense teams are passing less.

However, when we look at assists, things get interesting: Golden State’s assists per possession went *up* in the playoffs, while Miami’s went down. So it certainly appears that Golden State became slightly more heliocentric in the playoffs than in the regular season.

Okay, let’s look at the big picture. Does above average motion efficiency lead to playoff wins? Here's MOE playoff rank and win total

1. Denver Nuggets (1)
2. Golden State Warriors (16)
3. Boston Celtics (14)
4. Phoenix Suns (7)
5. Philadelphia 76ers (6)
6. Miami Heat (11)
7. Chicago Bulls (1)
8. Memphis Grizzlies (6)
9. Brooklyn Nets (0)
10. New Orleans Pelicans (2)
11. Minnesota Timberwolves (2)
12. Toronto Raptors (2)
13. Dallas Mavericks (9)
14. Atlanta Hawks (1)
15. Milwaukee Bucks (7)
16. Utah Jazz (4)

There’s a lot to unpack here, but one thing is very obvious: A better than average motion offense in the playoffs is highly correlated to playoff wins. In fact, 2 of the top 3 top teams indexed for MOE were in the finals!

What about the effectiveness of the offense overall? Remember, during the regular season, MOE correlated more to mediocre offenses than good ones. Do the playoffs make MOE shine?

|Team|\*MOE\*|\*MOE rk\*|OffRtg|Otg Rk.|

:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|

|New Orleans Pelicans|100.1|10|115.6|1|

|Brooklyn Nets|100.7|9|115|2|

|Phoenix Suns|105.8|4|114.9|3|

|Golden State Warriors|110.2|2|114.5|4|

|Denver Nuggets|114.0|1|113.9|5|

|Dallas Mavericks|93.3|13|113.9|6|

|Philadelphia 76ers|103.2|5|112.3|7|

|Miami Heat|102.3|6|110.7|8|

|Boston Celtics|108.6|3|110.3|9|

|Memphis Grizzlies|101.3|8|109.8|10|

|Toronto Raptors|95.4|12|109.6|11|

|Utah Jazz|85.3|16|108.4|12|

|Minnesota Timberwolves|96.9|11|105.8|13|

|Atlanta Hawks|92.9|14|104.1|14|

|Milwaukee Bucks|88.2|15|103.4|15|

|Chicago Bulls|102.0|7|94.4|16|

This is a stunning difference. 3 of the top 5 MOE teams are also 3 of the top 5 playoff teams in offensive efficiency. This also explains two outliers that we saw above in terms of MOE to playoff wins: Denver and Dallas.

Denver had the highest MOE yet only one playoff win. You can’t blame their motion offense, though, as the in-out motion offense of Denver was also top five overall in offensive efficiency. The answer must be their defense or their match-up.

Dallas is the opposite They had a very low MOE but a high number of playoff wins. Again, the answer must include their defense, because their offense was top 6, just in a different way — a heliocentric offense.

The Dallas Story

Dallas is worth a deeper look. They are the only team that wasn’t top ten in MOE during the playoffs that was top ten in offensive efficiency. *You can legitimately say that they were the only successful heliocentric playoff team.* What made them successful? Certainly defense was part of it, and the Dallas defense is very good. But the only other factor that makes sense is that Dallas’ heliocentric offense is just that good on the execution side.

Note that I said heliocentric and not Luka-centric. Luka is a massive part of Dallas’ entire offense, but the other Dallas guards run the offense in the exact same way — Spencer Dinwiddie and Jalen Brunson hold the ball and attack the rim or they switch and shoot a three.

What MOE tells us

As a stat, MOE illustrates the teams that out-perform the league at creating good looks through passing — not through switches, isolations, or pick and rolls. As we see (uniquely) with Denver, motion can be into the post and back out or, as we see with Golden State, around the perimeter using off ball movement and passing.

MOE doesn’t correlate to a strong regular season offense. It actually seems to correlate more to mediocre offense than anything. However, MOE does correlate to playoff success, with the only outlier being the Dallas Mavericks, who seem to have maximized the talents of their guards to create an almost uniquely successful heliocentric playoff offense.",[OC] Introducing MOE: A Qualitative Measure of Movement Offenses

nba,"Stoned, I wondered if an NBA player had ever had a boxscore that expressed the date of the game. For example, on today's date 6/18/2022, you would have to achieve of box score of 6 PTS / 18 REB / 22 AST.

I chose the American date convention of MM/DD/YYYY. This immediately excluded all scores with more than 12 points. As the NBA was founded in 1946, and no player has ever logged more than 30 assists ([Scott Silke](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199012300ORL.html)), which meant that I only had to check boxscores from 2000 on. Thank god.

Thanks to a very helpful basketball-reference.com API, I was able write a little python script that would check every player's boxscore from every game to see if it matched the date. I'm sure there was a more clever way to do this given how many dates have practically impossible scores (e.g., the monster statline 1p/27r/19a), but here we are: **a player has scored the date 42 times in league history.**

The complete list is at the bottom, but here are some interesting takeaways:

* No player has accomplished this feat more than once. Truly a lifetime achievement.
* The last player to score the date was Rajon Rondo for the Boston Celtics, putting up a 4/7/12 statline on April 7th, 2012.
* The highest game score for any player scoring the date came on December 13th, 2001, when Ben Wallace contributed 12 points, 13 rebounds, and an assist to a Pistons win over the Knicks (game score of 16.9).
* The team of a player scoring the date has a 54.8% win rate. Compared to the league-wide average win rate of 50.0%, this shows a statistically significant advantage for the player's team. It's winning basketball, baby!
* The Sixers, Bucks, Pacers, Spurs, Celtics, and Warriors have all had three players accomplish this feat.
* Every team has had a player accomplish this except for:
   * OKC Thunder. Get fucked, Oklahoma. Stolen from Seattle in 2008, the Thunder missed they early-2000's heyday of date-scoring. Only 3 of the 42 dates that have been scored were achieved after 2008. (Jelani McCoy secured his spot on the Seattle's Mt. Rushmore with his 2/1/0 masterclass on February 1st, 2000.) 
   * Phoenix Suns
   * Houston Rockets
   * New Orleans Pelicans
* Five players scored the date on April 2nd, 2000 (4p, 2r, 0a), the most of any one day:
   * Žan Tabak (IND)
   * Devean George (LAL)
   * Gheorghe Mureșan (NJN)
   * Stacey Augmon (POR)
   * Corey Benjamin (CHI)
* Other recognizable names include Steve Kerr, with 11/1/2 on November 1st, 2002, and Vlade Divac, scoring 4/6/3 on April 6th, 2003.

The future for scoring the date looks pretty grim. The assist-year relationship is a real bottleneck, as anyone scoring the date now would have to log 22+ assists. [22+ assists have been logged 45 times](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ast_game.html), with the only active players being Rajon Rondo and Russell Westbrook:

* Rajon Rondo: 
   * 25 -- December 27th, 2017
   * 24 -- October 29th, 2010
   * 23 -- January 5th, 2011
* Russell Westbrook:
   * 24 -- May 3rd, 2021
   * 24 -- January 10th, 2019
   * 22 -- December 17th, 2016

Given that Russ and Rondo are 33 and 36 years old respectively, it doesn't look good.

If the NBA makes it to the year 2100, the doors to basketball immortality will open once again. But given the current state of the United States, it seems likely that the date has already been scored by an NBA player for the last time.

Golden State won a championship in 2015, with home grown draft pick like Curry, Thompson and Green. But, they could not repeat this until they signed Kevin Durant in free agency. Not only did Durant help them win 2 titles, but he afforeded the organization the luxury of trading him, essentially, for Andrew Wiggins and a 1st round pick (who turned out to be the number 7 pick in the draft, Jonathan Kuminga).

&gt; The three-time All-Star appeared Saturday afternoon at the dedication of two refurbished basketball courts near Howard University, and when he stood at the top of the 3-point arc and squared his shoulders to take the ceremonial first shot — his first shot in public since Jan. 29, the night he injured his wrist in Memphis — a child seated nearby yelled, “Brick!”

&gt; It was an audacious thing to say to the person who had contributed financially to the court renovation project, but Beal took the gibe in stride, turning toward the kids, scrunching his face and asking, “Who said that?!?”

&gt; Beal air-balled his first attempt and clanked his second off the rim before he finally sank a 3, and then smiled.

&gt; Whether Beal made or missed shots Saturday wasn’t the point. The court unveiling at the city-owned Banneker Recreation Center commemorated Juneteenth and celebrated a partnership between Beal, the nonprofit Hoop For All Foundation, the National Basketball Players Association, city officials, Monumental Sports and others to rejuvenate the playing surfaces and baskets. As a child growing up in St. Louis, Beal often played hoops on public courts, and Saturday, he reveled in helping the District’s children do the same.

Oddly enough, though, Magic shouldn't have gotten FMPV in 1980: Kareem dropped 33/13/3 vs. 21/11/8.  Magic had that great game 6, of course, but Kareem also had that amazing game 5, playing hurt. 

Bird should have also got the award in 1981. 15/15/7?  That is ridiculously good! Sure, Maxwell for 3 more points. but 6 fewer boards and 4 fewer assists.

Why for TOR: upgrading PG2 from Flynn to Monte Morris seems worth a protected first and a fringe rotation big. Also, potentially getting second(s) back, not sure. I think the world of Morris, but of course I do. 

Why for DET: #18, a future first, and Coby White seems like a pretty good return for Grant who's expiring. Maybe they get that CHI second also.

nba,"In his prime, Pete Maravich was a depressed, alcoholic insomniac who many considered to be completely insane. Born without a left coronary artery, he was suffering from a heart condition that took most of its victims by twenty, and was meant to make being an athlete completely impossible.

He was also one of the most innovative players in basketball history, the precursor to the passing of Bird and Magic and the dribbling moves of Isiah Thomas, and nobody matched his propensity for 30 foot shots in transition for many years to come. The feats that he accomplished on the court have been matched by few in history, but whatever he did was never enough. On the road to reaching the NBA's mountain top, he brought the basketball world joy and himself misery.

Upbringing:

Pete had what many people would consider to be an abusive childhood, as his father Press geared him to become what he would later describe as ""a basketball android"". He was forced to play basketball 8-10 hours per day, and Press intentionally hit him in the face with a baseball when he wanted to play that sport instead. In another instance, Press told Pete’s football coach to tell the team's O-Line not to block for Pete when he wanted to play QB (Press had some sway locally as he was the head coach for Clemson basketball at the time). Reportedly, Press threatened to shoot Pete with a 45 caliber pistol if he ever drank or got into trouble in his youth; nothing could derail his future as an NBA great.

Press Maravich originally got his son hooked on basketball by playing outside with a giant smile on his face, making it seem like the most fun thing in the world. When a very young Pete asked to play with him, Press said he was too small and weak, causing Pete to adopt the game out of jealousy.

From there, Press relentlessly trained his son and prioritized basketball over everything else. Press told his young son that if he listened to what his father said, he would become a million dollar player who could win an NBA championship, and that these accomplishments would make Pete the happiest man in the world. The thoughts of achieving these dreams would come to consume Pete.

Pete was playing for his high school's varsity team by the seventh grade. It was around this time that he earned the nickname ""Pistol"", as he was very skinny even for his age and looked as if he was hoisting jump shots from his hip.

It was also around this time that Pete began to develop his innovative and revolutionary basketball skills, especially for the time. He has described throwing a behind the back pass that went through the defender’s legs on a fast break, leading to a score. The small high school crowd erupted, unable to comprehend what they had just seen. In this moment, showtime was born, as doing the seemingly impossible on the court gave Pete a reason to play for himself.

College Career:

While Pete had originally wanted to play for West Virginia University (which had a very good team) and become their next Jerry West, he joined LSU’s team after heavy pressure from Press, who was the coach.

The season before Pete arrived, LSU finished 3-23 and just 1-17 in the SEC. After a decade of terrible basketball, the program was at an all-time low.

At LSU, Maravich averaged 44.2 points per game in total, obliterating the NCAA's total D-1 scoring record in just three seasons. In his senior year, he accounted for 57 points per game between points and assists despite there being no three point line, and won the Naismith Men's College Player of the Year Award.

For three years, Pistol Pete turned a football school into a basketball one, and despite being a collegiate player, he was as big a star as any player in the world.

Some of the stories are incredible. On the last game of his junior year, LSU was playing AT Georgia. Pete lead an insane comeback, hitting the shot at the horn to take it into OT. Behind a ridiculous run from Pete, LSU began to pull away in overtime. Pete then froze the ball for the final minute or two to preserve LSU's eight-point lead. By this point, the UGA fans were chanting “PISTOL”, as they were witnessing a show they would likely never see again. With time winding down, UGA called off their defense and admitted defeat. Pete dribbled to mid court, and as time expired, shot a hook shot, turned, began to trot to his locker, and sunk it. As he was jogging to the locker, the UGA fans and cheerleaders stormed the court and carried HIM off on their shoulders.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8qUZILi8IM (highlights of a young Pete putting on a show from the limited footage available)

He transformed LSU into the second best team in the SEC by his final season, and they earned a final four berth in the NIT (meant to be consisting of the 26th-41st best teams in college basketball).

In the tournament, LSU defeated Georgetown and Oklahoma in the first two rounds. However, they lost in the semis to a Marquette team that was ranked eighth in all of college basketball and famously (at the time) declined to play in the NCAA tournament in favor of the NIT due to travel demands. Marquette easily won the tournament.

Pete was hacked throughout the tournament to get him off of his rhythm; by the end of the tournament he was said to have had swelling on his head, a bruised hip, a strained ligament, and a sprained ankle in addition to a stomach bug that caused him to lose ten pounds.

Reflecting on his fame and speculation about his future after the tournament, Pete said ""I tell you, everybody think's I've got it made but, you know, it's not worth it. There is so much pressure, and people—every day, every day. You know when I've had the most fun? When I went to Daytona all by myself last year and just took it easy. Nobody knew me. Sometimes I wish I could be an accountant or something, man, so I could live right for a change"".

Speaking on how he handled the negative attention that came with losing in the tournament, Pete said ""When I play that bad, I try to forget it. I'll just go hide in my little corner."" By his corner, he was referring to an East Side bar where he went to drink away the disappointment that came from whatever he did and whatever he accomplished never being enough. In the years prior, Pete's mother, Helen, had become increasingly addicted to liquor corresponding with her unhappiness. It seemed as if Pete, who to the outside world had everything going for him, had begun to go down the same path.

nba,,‘Stuff of legends’: Warriors’ Klay Thompson caps long comeback with NBA championship
nba," 
Darth Vader - Kevin Durant.
The dark side is strong in this one. Once a promising young Padawan, Darth Durant abandoned his Jedi training after a crushing defeat and joined the empire (the Golden State Warriors). He went on to rule the galaxy, but the respect of a two time champion eludes him. Many fans and media figures consider his rings tainted because of their circumstances; joining the already dominant Warriors a season after having them on the verge of playoff elimination, only to lose the series in stunning fashion.
 
He made the jump the light speed and landed in a Brooklyn Nets jersey, where he plans to win a title as the figurehead of the team (ala Lebron in Cleveland) and legitimize himself as a true master. His descent into the dark side continues as he allows his emotions to fuel him, lashing out at the rebel alliance, aka his haters, through burner social media accounts. Some believe there is still good in Darth Durant, but others say he’s more machine than man now, twisted and evil. 

Jar Jar Binks - Ben Simmons.
There’s no easy way to say this....nobody likes him. Me Sah unlikable. 

Baby Yoda (Grogu) - Luka Doncic.
Young fans and old, purist and causal, pundit and player, everyone loves Luka. He’s cute, he’s cuddly and a great new addition to the franchise, but underneath that exterior is a powerful Jedi who just needs a little help to reach his true potential. A beskar trophy has been foretold in Dallas, but the future is anything but certain. 


Hayden Christianson – ‘The Splash Brothers’ Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. 
After years removed from the spotlight, they’re back. At one point they had it all; the magazine covers, television spots, legions of fans and even more haters. After 3 rings and 3 films, many assumed it was over but here we are. Hayden gets his shot at redemption and closure, while the Splash Brothers look poised to sit the throne once more. 

 
Boba Fett - Anthony Davis. 
Boba Fett achieved cult like status from a few brief appearances in episode 5 and 6. Anthony Davis achieved cult like status from 1 incredible playoff run in the bubble that culminated in a championship. Plagued by injuries, will AD get a successful spinoff and prove he’s more than Bubble Fett, more than a product of playing with Lebron, or is he forever regulated to cult classic status? 

Mace Windu - James Harden 
Oh the hype. When it was announced that Samuel L Jackson would be in the prequel series, expectations were higher than Cloud City. His character, Mace Windu, was promised to be a master swordsman, second only to master Yoda. Throughout the comics, novels and cartoons we were shown glimpses of his mastery and couldn’t wait to see him on the big screen. James Harden is pre film Mace Windu. Triple double here, MVP there, step back three, etc. BUT, when the true battle for the galaxy starts and he’s up against other force users...he gets electrocuted and thrown out of a window. 

Han Solo - Russell Westbrook 
There’s no question, Westbrook shot first. He’s been all around the galaxy making trouble, a real scoundrel with the triple double. People have their criticisms, some valid, but even the harshest critic can’t deny he’s got style. Westbrook has the ratings, highlights and numbers, but can he find championship success within an alliance? Will he stick with his trusty blaster or give an old, hokey religion a chance?

Also Han Solo - Disgraced referee Tim Donaghy  
Never tell him the odds. 

Kylo Ren - Kyrie Irving 
Misunderstood, immature, a little annoying? His mastery of the force is undeniable but his motives leave us puzzled. With loving parents and a Jedi mentor (uncle Luke), why dedicate your life to destroy the very thing they risked theirs to save? Kids these days. 
 
Tusken Raiders – Also Kyrie Irving
What exactly are they saying?

Damian Lillard - The Mandalorian 
He lives by the old ways, the creed of his ancestors; honor, loyalty, no super teams. Committed to his home planet, Portlandia, he fights an uphill battle to return his people to prominence. Can an ancient ideology bring a championship in today’s modern league, who’s to say, but to Dame, this is the way. 


Captain Phasma = Zion Williamson 
The Force Awakens trailer blew us all away. Wow, who’s the absolute unit in the silver armor? We bought the ticket, the overpriced popcorn and waited...and waited. The fans wanted the next Boba Fett but were given Boba Flat. Bad writing and a bad injury.  Perhaps Phasma will find new life in the extended universe, and perhaps Zion will become the Chewbacca like beast we all hoped. 
 
Emperor Palpatine - Lebron James. 
The mastermind, pulling strings and winning rings. Dewayne Wade, Kyrie Irving  and Anthony Davis, his apprentices have served him well, but are no match for his true apprentice, his blood, Bronny James. Following the Sith ‘Rule of Two,’ (one to embody the power, the other to crave it) they will rule the galaxy as father and son. Lebron haters beware, when this comes to fruition, Lebrons’ game will be quite operational. 
 
Luke Skywalker – Jayson Tatum
 His training is complete; he is a Jedi like the Celtic greats before him. Tatum boarded the Deathstar and swept Brooklyn. He defeated Jedi Master Giannis on Hoth and took game 7 from bounty hunter Butler on Mustafar. Now, in the final showdown of the season, he must face his destiny.

nba," As the 4X NBA Champion Draymond Green once said, ""there are 82-game players, then there are 16-game players"". Indeed, the regular season and the playoffs have become increasingly distinct.

**Which players worsened their standing during this postseason?**

The high stakes win-at-all-costs environment and the different gameplans in the playoffs often make great regular season players/teams underperform. This environment often exposes weaknesses in a player's skillset, as well as weaknesses in their mentality.

**Which players improved their standing during this postseason?**

But the opposite is also true. The increased attention on every game means that overlooked players can prove their worth to the broader fanbase. This is especially the case for young guys, because we often see players' abilities blossom in real time during their first playoff runs.

**Which players redefined their identity during this postseason?** (There can easily be a lot of overlap between this category and the previous two categories)

In some cases, the previously mentioned gameplan/coaching differences can result in players being used in totally different roles than before, thus reshaping their identity on the court.","How have your player rankings/opinions changed during this postseason? Which players do you now see in a better/worse/different light, and to what extent did your opinions change?"

nba,"All this dynasty talk seems to happen almost every playoff....and a big reason for that is because big dynasty teams are almost in the playoffs. 

While the Warriors are somewhat of an exception because they drafted such a comparatively large amount of their roster - what they still have in common is having one of the biggest payrolls. In fact, the highest this year. And for the most part, being at the top of luxury tax is really only viable for big market teams. I don't mean to oversimplify things and there are some wonderful examples that counter this - but they mostly stick out as anomalies. 

So why, and this is a genuine question that people may have insight into, doesn't the NBA want the field leveled? In organizations like the NFL it has helped the league become the #1 grossing sports industry and it's helped fans of long time losers still have a real shot at a turnaround. (looking at you Bengals) In the NFL this is often referred to as parity. That most teams are competitive with all the others, most of the time.

So are there really some large cons to a similar model with a hard salary cap? Do big market teams really make for better playoffs, at least financially? Don't fans get sick of being out of the playoffs and praying to strike gold on the lottery? And then hope they can get their big stars to stay in small market!

Maybe the small organizations don't care enough? Maybe winning doesn't really affect their bottom line that much, I don't know. But as fans - why don't more people push for this? Do you guys favor a hard cap? Is there any good reason for the NBA to make that change? I truly don't know - please inform me mighty NBA nerds.",Why don't small market teams band together and push for a hard salary cap?
nba,"Hello Guys, it's me again! 
The reason for this take is simple. Accolades aside, Kevin Durant was the Warrior's best player during the years that He was a member of them and that says alot. Him being the best in the same team just means He was better and much more valuable (FMVP is the nail in the coffin). Curry might end up with a better career/legacy but at the end of the day, KD beats him in terms of being the better player.

nba,"Just to go over what Steph’s accomplished this season:

1. In December, Steph breaks the all time three point record, becoming the most prolific 3-point shooter ever. 

2. Wins the All Star Game MVP off of an insane 50-point game. Even more impressive were some of the shots he was taking to get to that total. [For your viewing pleasure](https://youtu.be/nH2ePndVEKo)

3. Wins the NBA championship, showing that he and the Warriors are still a threat to the league. 

4. Arguably most importantly, Steph wins the Finals MVP that so many treated as a mark on his career. 

He might not have had extremely high season stats or a regular season MVP (although with the back to back of 2015/2016, I’m sure he’s not worried), but just based off these three trophies and one record, I think Steph accomplished a ton this season (and this is coming from someone who isn’t a dubs fan).

Curry has shown he can handle his own on defense and has laid the blueprint for JP. I know he will put in the work and become at minimum a decent defender.

Now, you wonder why Kevin Durant joining the Golden State was the hardest road ever taken, right? In order to understand Durant's hardest road, we have to start with how hard it was for him to win a championship? The night is May 16 2016, when Oklahoma Thunder is up 3-1 against Golden State Warriors in western conference semi-final. Durant felt the road to championship was too easy and wanted a harder road to become an nba champion. So, Kevin Durant let Golden State Warriors f\*\*k him hard. In fact, they f\*\*\*\*ed him so hard, he went on to be their b\*\*\*h for next 3 years. But now, you might think how is this is the hardest road right? And yeah, you are right, the hardest road was yet to come...

As soon as Kevin Durant decided to leave the warriors in 2019, he teamed up with his former teammate, Westbrook, to make his path even harder. Now, how can Westbrook help his situation? right? And, yeah I was wondering that too. So, I researched and found that Westbrook is famous for laying bricks. Westbrook started to pave harder road for Durant by laying bricks in Houston Rockets and created a bridge of bricks for Harden. The bridge was ready but the road was not hard yet. The hardest road was almost complete but a Greek-Freak decided to make Durant's road even harder.  The hardest road was not still two season away.

With the season progressing in 2021-2022, the hardest road for KD started to be visible. Tatum started building bricks upon bricks and has showed KD his new hardest way. With golden state becoming NBA champion without KD, KD's hardest road has finally been paved completely by Tatum. KD now has the hardest choice in teaming up with yet another team who f\*\*\*ed him harder this season. Now, Celtics not only f\*\*\*ed Durant out of series and went on to lose the championship just like Golden State in 2016 but they lost to KD's ex. The road is harder because Celtics have f\*\*\*ed him harder than golden state.  And, what better story next season if warrior make the finals and Durant finally completes his hardest journey to championship by beating warriors in Celtics jersey?

nba,,"[Slater] - Entire Warriors locker room is chanting “fuck you, Draymond” in champagne celebration right now."
nba,"The Anthony David trade was one the biggest trade in recent history but its impact is actually often overlooked imo. The Lakers gave up a huge haul for AD which set e new floor for superstar trades.

What the Lakers gave up to get AD ( who had only one year left on his contract and only wanted to go to the Lakers ) :  Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, 3 first round picks and 2 pick swaps.

Now lets look at other superstar trade just a few years prior to this one to compare.

* The Kawhi to Toronto trade ( who had only one year in his contract and didn't want to go to Toronto ) ; Spurs got Demar Derozan, Jakob Poeltl and a first round pick for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.
* The Kyrie Irving to Boston trade ( had 2 years on his deal )  : Cavs got Isiah Thomas, Ante Zizic, Jae Crowder and a first round pick ( via Brooklyn which was projected and ended up being a lottery pick )
* The PG to OKC trade ( had one year on his deal ) : Indy got Oladipo and Sabonis, thats it , no picks ( granted they both ended up being really good but at the time it was seen as a steal by the Thunder )
* The Jimmy Butler to the Wolves trade ( 2 years left on his deal )  : Bulls got Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn and the #7 pick.
* Chris Paul to the Rockets sign &amp; trade : Clippers got Pat Bet, Lou Williams, Trez, Sam Dekker and a first round pick.
* Jimmy Butler to Philly trade ( 6 months left on his deal ) : Wolves got Jarred Bayless, Robert Covingto, Dario Saric and a second round pick.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say that for all these trades, teams who trade the superstar didn't get back a lot in value although you could argue that the Bulls and Indy did alright considering they got all stars in return but they kinda lucked out imo.

Now if you look at all the superstar trades after the AD trade:

* Paul George to Clippers trade ( granted PG had 4 years one his deal and Clippers were kinda trading for 2 superstars since Kawhi doesn't come without PG but I think the point stands regardless  since this ballooned to a record haul ) : Okc got back Danilo Gallinari, SGA, 5 first round picks and 2 pick swaps
* Russ to the Rockets trade : Okc got back Chris Paul, 2 first round picks and 2 pick swaps.
* Harden to the Nets trade ( this was a 4 team trade so I'll just mention what Nets gave up since its easier ) : Nets gave up Jarret Allen, Chris Evert, Taruean Prince, 3 first round picks and 4 pick swaps.
* Harden to Philly trade : Nets got back Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and 2 first round picks.
* Jrue Holiday to the Bucks trade ( not a superstar but still worth noting. This also ended up being a 4 team trade so I'll just mention what the Bucks gave up ) : Bucks gave up Eric Bledsoe, George Hill, 3 first round picks and 2 pick swaps for Jrue Holiday.

Before the AD trade, everytime you traded for a superstar you seemingly got back worse value every time buit after the Lakers overpaid for AD ( it worked out for them in the end since they won a chip ) the superstar trade market completely changed.

Teams that trade for a superstar nowadays have to basically give up all their assets and leave themselves little to no room to improve further ( like trading for another star for example alla Big 3 Boston ) .

Ofc sometimes it works out like in the Lakers and Bucks cases because stars are stars but at the same time, trading for a star isn't the sure fire bet it once was. There is a lot more risk involved and you might not always win the trade.

This imo has made fans look building organically as a better, safer option. Golden State winning a chip once more adds even more credibility to this.",the AD trade killed the superteam era and made building organically cool
